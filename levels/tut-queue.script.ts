// each finds its men by callsign and takes only the ones still up, so a checkpoint put back in the middle of the mission stages what is left of it.
//
// What is scripted is only what the split is FOR: the hall's gun stays on the front door until a door of the hall opens — and when both open on one word it
// is still on the wrong one; the men outside stay outside until the squad has been turned to the two gates, and then come by both at once.
// (The beats are the plan mode mission's, levels/tut-plan.script.ts, which this floor came from: a copy, so that mission can go without this one moving.)
