// with the pair or the four) and the hostage rescue (game/rescue.ts + rescueflow.ts) — read their rooms, doors, marks and team start from here and from nowhere
// else, so a level that carries a block is a level they run on. Types, and one pure function (scenarioQuery): nothing here imports the game.
//
// Door names are the level's own door ids (Doors.byName); light groups are its switchable groups (Game.setGroup); every point is world metres on the floor (y 0)
// unless it is something a gun rests on (y ≈ 1.1). What the data must satisfy against the floor is checked in the game, headless: roomclear.ts checkStructure,
// rescue.ts checkRescue, rescueflow.ts RescueFlow.check — tools/qa/scenario-level-probes.ts runs all three on a level file.
