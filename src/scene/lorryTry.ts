// A LORRY WITH CURVES, A TRIAL (the look page only: main.ts lorryTryOn; ?lorry=0 = the lorry as its file has it). Asked 2026-10-24 on a picture of the pass's
// yard: "some curved surfaces on the truck would go a long way". The pass's lorry is twenty plain boxes under four flat slabs of snow; from above every
// line of it is straight. Here it is gone over by hand after the level loads (as the house front is, scene/frontTry.ts; levels/pass.json is not touched):
//   · the canvas tilt is BOWED over its hoops, and its snow lies on the bow;
//   · the cab's roof is an arch from the windscreen back, the windscreen leans, and the roof's snow lies on the arch;
//   · the bonnet is a narrow engine cover with a rounded top between two FENDERS that arch over the front wheels; snow on each;
//   · the wheels are round, with hubs; the headlamps are round in pods; a round tank hangs under the bed on each side.
// Made of what the engine has: a round prism (Box.cutRound: twelve sides about the box's own middle) for what is round all the way, and for a shallow curve
// AN ARC (Box.cutArc): a box whose top is cut to seven facets of a circle whose axis lies well under the box, shaded as one round face about that axis.
// ONE MODEL: each piece is a real box to every ray (sight, a round, a lamp's shadow), and what pushes against it meets the uncut box, as with every cut box.
// WHAT A RAY AND A BODY MEET IS NOT THE LEVEL'S LORRY: the bonnet (1.5 m high, 0.98 m a side) is a hump 0.56 m a side that tops out at 1.46 m, with a fender
// of at most 1.08 m beside it and, for 0.63 m in front of each fender, only the 0.78 m bumper; the tilt's eaves come down from 1.95 m to 1.6 m; a tank closes a
// metre of the gap under the bed on each side. Sight and rounds across the nose change on this page. Never seen on a GPU.

/** THE LORRY'S FITTINGS, A TRIAL ON THE TRIAL (the look page only, with the lorry's curves on: main.ts; `?lorrykit=0` = the curved lorry without them). Asked
 *  2026-10-30 on a picture of it at midday beside the yard's new round props: "truck could use some dressing up. but overall the round surfaces look nice".
 *  From above the curved lorry is still three plain masses: a cab, a tilt and a nose. Here it gets what a lorry of its kind carries where a camera over the
 *  yard sees it: an exhaust stack up the cab's back corner, mirrors on arms, a beacon, steps under the doors, a door seam and a handle a side, an air cleaner on
 *  the cowl, a winch drum, hooks and a plate on the bumper, stakes down the sideboards, three jerry cans racked on one of them, mud flaps, tail lamps, and the
 *  spare wheel on the tailboard. Rounds are prisms of twelve sides (ring), as on the rest of it; every colour is a row of the level's palette.
 *  ONE MODEL: each piece is a real box to a ray and to a body. The spare stands 0.3 m off the tailboard between 0.75 and 1.71 m; a mirror stands out as far
 *  as the bank of snow along that side does. Never seen on a GPU. Returns how many boxes it added: 0 = not this lorry. */
