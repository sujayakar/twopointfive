// A GEOMETRY TRIAL (the look page only: main.ts, with ?look; ?geo=0 leaves it out — off on every other page, and nothing here keeps state).
// What else can a box-only level be made of? The answer tried here is the CUT BOX (scene/cut.ts): a box clipped by up to eight planes, which the raster, every GPU
// ray and every CPU ray already meet as one solid. Two things are rebuilt from the level's own boxes, after it loads and before the world is filled:
//   ROUND THINGS. The kit (scene/gwotKit.ts round) stands a drum, a tyre, a stove up as four slabs 45° apart: an octagon of four boxes. Here the first slab becomes
//     a regular TWELVE-sided prism (the box's four faces + eight planes: the record's whole room), marked ROUND (Box.cutRound) so the picture shades its sides with
//     one turning normal; the other three are left in the list (a level file's box indices are names) as specks no pass and no ray meets.
//   A BROKEN WALL TOP. A yard wall (a long thin box with the open sky on both hands, on the renderer's floor plan) loses a bite out of its top: the wall is split at the bite, and the gap is
//     three to five boxes whose tops are cut on a slant, each at its own height, so the line is ragged and the shadow it throws is too. The coping stops at the break, the
//     snow lying on it is cut back, and the faces of the break show the wall's core. No bite goes lower than a standing man's eyes.
// What pushes against a box still meets the UNCUT box: a man slides round the prism's square, a hand's width out from the round at its four corners.
