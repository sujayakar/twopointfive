// ROUND THINGS ARE ROUND ("Round things into the game": drums, tyres, stoves, the oven).
// The level kit (scene/gwotKit.ts round) stands a round thing up as an OCTAGON of four slabs through one centre, 45° apart, and every level file carries those four
// boxes. With the switch up, when a level is stood up (host/standup.ts populateHost, before its boxes go to the world and before the Game is built) each octagon
// becomes ONE box that is ROUND (Box.round): the cylinder about the box's own y, radius h[0] (= h[2]), half height h[1].
//
// ONE MODEL — everybody meets the same round:
//   · the picture: the g-buffer's cut pass draws it (a twelve-sided prism standing round the cylinder; its sides shaded with one turning normal, its marks run
//     round it, a rolled rim on its lid — gbuffer_cut.wgsl ROUND);
//   · GPU rays: common.wgsl isectBox behind the scene prelude's `const ROUND_BOXES` (shadows, bounce, reflections, the light meter, smoke sight lines, particles);
//     the programs compiled with the cut rule (render/cutSwap.ts: the set drawn while a cut piece a ray can meet is alive) trace it as the picture's own prism,
//     through the cut test and the eight rows boxes.ts wrote for the picture: up to 3.5 % of the radius further out at the twelve corners, the side's normal
//     still the cylinder's. The cylinder's test on top of the cut test in every box walk was more than a newer software adapter ran (`?roundexact=1` = as it was);
//   · CPU rays and segments: boxes.ts rayBox, collision.ts lineBox (rounds, aim, sight, sound, throw arcs, the cursor);
//   · MOVEMENT: collision.ts collideCircle / circleTouches push a body off the circle, and the walk grid is baked by the same question.
// What still meets the box round it (a square of side 2 × radius, its sides along the world's axes): the trace grid's and the ray grid's registration (a superset:
// it only costs a test), a shoved prop's, a ragdoll's and a piece of debris's own contact, the smoke solver's obstacle bake, the replay's map, and a blast, which
// takes it as that box (furnblast.ts). A round thing a round can chew through (wallbreak.ts: one in a cover paint) is ONE cell: it goes whole, never in pieces.
//
// The other three slabs stay in the list where they were (a level file's box indices are names) as specks no pass, ray or body meets. What each box was is kept
// on it (Box.was): the level's fingerprint is taken over the boxes AS AUTHORED (savestate.ts), so a checkpoint or a recording is this level's with the switch up
// or down, and roundLevel(…, false) puts every box back.
//
// THE SWITCH: ROUND.on — ON in the page (`?round=0` puts it off), OFF in the module and on the frozen
// stand (FROZEN_HOLDS; TPS_ROUND=1 raises it there). Read ONCE, as a level is stood up: a recording from before the table has it put down before its level stands
// (roundTape: replay/engineplay.ts and tools/qa/rerun.ts `tables`; journal.ts applyKnobs says the same afterwards), and the debugger's row reloads the page. Off =
// no box touched, no flag, no branch taken: the build as it was by run digest. The GPU's half is roundConfig.gpu, raised at boot before the first pipeline is
// compiled (main.ts: the switch AND the cut switch, whose table and pipeline draw a round); without it (`?nocutboxes`) a round box is drawn and traced by the GPU as
// the square box round it while the game still meets the cylinder — the switch is the simulation's, and a picture setting may not move it.
// CHECK: tools/qa/round-check.ts (probes.ts round; ROUND_BREAK=1 must fail), both stands. Nothing here has been seen on a GPU.
