// THE SCENARIO LIST: the curated scenarios the mission list offers (ui/missions.ts renders one row per entry; main.ts boots the one the URL names) and the pure
// helpers between a row and the page's query string. A scenario with a level of its own is ONE NEW ROW here — `level` names its file under levels/, whose own
// `scenarios` block carries the marks (scene/scenarios.ts LevelScenarios) — and no picker code.
//
// PICKING IS A PAGE LOAD. A row's href is scenarioQuery(entry) with the visitor's other flags kept (pickSearch): the page boots on the entry's level and
// game/scenarioRun.ts starts it from the query — the one code path for a click and for a pasted URL. So a level is only ever loaded at boot, and the scenarios'
// module-level team-start knobs (NIGHTBREACH.samAt, RESCUE.opsAt — written once per team start) never meet two levels in one page.
// Types and pure functions: nothing here imports the game (but game/loadout.ts — itself types and pure functions, importing nothing at run time: keep it so) or
// touches the DOM.
