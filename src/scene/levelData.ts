// LevelData: the level as DATA — the JSON schema every level file (levels/*.json) is written in, its validator, canonical serializer and digest.
//
// What lives here vs elsewhere:
//   scene/level.ts      the RUNTIME shape the game consumes (Level: Box[] with bit flags and array indices, LightDef[], PropDef[], plans…) + buildLevel()
//   scene/levelData.ts  (this) the AUTHORED shape: string ids everywhere, flags by name, materials by key, box references by id, nothing derived
//   scene/levelLoad.ts  the two conversions: loadLevel(LevelData) → Level (what the game boots from) and levelToData(Level, opts) → LevelData (the exporter's
//                       direction: tools/level-export.ts runs the legacy procedural generator once and writes levels/office.json)
//
// Design rules (the in-browser editor — lane G1b — and later lanes G2 floors / G4 devices build on this, and the maintainer hand-edits the JSON):
//   - every entity carries a stable string `id`, unique within its array; cross references are ALWAYS by id (a light's fixture box, a switchable's boxes,
//     the breaker's two boxes, a beacon's dome, a plan's door, an objective's door), never by array index — the loader resolves ids to the indices the
//     runtime wants. Array ORDER is still preserved by the loader (boxes[i] of the file is world.statics[i]), so a file diff is an entity diff.
//   - no derived data: nothing the loader or the game computes is stored (area lights off emissive fixtures, AreaLit / Emissive flags, door-leaf boxes,
//     nav / reach / collision bakes). Two deliberate exceptions, both flagged where they occur: PropData.half / height MAY be stored to pin a footprint
//     the fit would not reproduce (plants author theirs), and door FRAME boxes are plain boxes today (group 'doorframe.<door>') because the generator
//     emitted them as geometry — the editor may regenerate them from the door when it moves one.
//   - optional fields mean "the default": absent yaw = 0, absent flags = none, absent mains = fed from the breaker, absent floor = the first floor.
//     The exporter writes a field iff the source had it, so levels/office.json round-trips the procedural level key for key.
//   - numbers are stored at full double precision (JSON's shortest round-trip form): rounding even to 4 decimals moves wall slabs whose centres are
//     sums like (x0 + x1) / 2, and the identity gate (tools/qa/level-probes.ts) is bit-for-bit.
//   - versioned: `version` is bumped on any breaking change; the loader refuses versions it does not know.
