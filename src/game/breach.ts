// The breach DRILL: two operatives with FN2000s run up at the low ready, stack on a room's door, boot it, put a stun charge in the instant the leaf clears, go in
// on the bang — #1 through the fatal funnel and a stride and a half straight in, a check across the middle and the man standing in it dropped, then his corner; #2
// on his heels the other way — end in an L owning the room and its next door, and stack on that door. Both operatives are scripted men (squad.ts's runner behind
// Guard.script, the drill below sequencing them the way RoomClear sequences the lockdown pair — battle drill six, the same doctrine RoomClear's live men keep).
//
// It began as the choreography of a daytime showcase (the office's level script, program 'breach', with a `Breach` facade here that main.ts and the probes drove).
// The two showcases were removed; what stays is BreachDrill — the one piece of choreography with fourteen clocks, kept statement for statement — which the night
// breach scenario runs LIVE on Sam's orders (game/nightbreach.ts, BreachLive) and a level script may still drive as a Director drill (game/director.ts D.drill).
// Its men are spawned UNITS (guards.ts spawnUnit: an operative's round finds a hostile through the ordinary fireWeapon and he goes down to the hit; the drill only
// aims and pulls the trigger on cue, and drops a man itself only if both rounds of his pair found furniture — `guaranteeDowns`, logged when it fires).
