// A SPOT THAT FITS THE ROOM (ROOMFIT, __game.orders 'move') — where each man stands, and what he watches, when Sam sends the squad to a spot.
// the maintainer, 10-10, a picture of three men shoulder to shoulder in the middle of an office, all looking the way Sam had pointed: "when squad is ordered to a spot,
// they should go there but their positions should roughly "make sense" for the room, where the doors are, what's cleared and what isn't, etc."
// 'move there' was a line abreast across the way Sam faced the point (orders.ts spotsAt), every man facing that same way and nobody named anything to watch.
//
//   WHAT THERE IS TO WATCH   the room read's ways out of the space the point is in (roomread.ts: its doors, leafless gaps, passage mouths) and, where the floor
//                 runs on a long way with no such line across it (a hall's length, a wide archway), that stretch of floor itself. Each is weighed: the nearer
//                 the heavier; floor the team has NOT stood on beyond it counts in full and known floor a third (cleared.ts — the way they came is still
//                 somebody's, after everything nobody has looked at); a shut leaf less than an open way, a locked one least; what lies the way Sam pointed a
//                 little more than what lies behind.
//   WHO WATCHES WHAT   the heaviest things first, one man each, never two men on one while another goes unwatched (a second gun on an uncleared way comes
//                 after every way has its first). A man with nothing left to take looks down the longest clear run nobody else is on.
//   WHERE HE STANDS   on floor of that same space within a few steps of the point (ROOMFIT.spread: the more men, the wider), and of that floor the place
//                 that is best for his job: a line to what he watches; OUT of the funnel of every way in (the strip a man coming through it shoots straight
//                 down) and at an angle to his own; a wall or a desk at his back before open floor; a body's room and more from every mate; nobody in his
//                 line and he in nobody's; never in a frame or where a leaf swings; and no further from the point than those are worth. One man alone goes
//                 onto the point itself, as he always did, and takes the heaviest thing he can see from it.
//   ON THE WALK   nothing changes: gun up and leading, as 'move' always had it. He takes up his watch over the last steps onto his mark (ROOMFIT.watchInM);
//                 he is 'in position' — and 'set.' is called — when his FEET are on it, as it always was (a man the fight has, or with a friend in his line,
//                 is not kept 'moving' for his gun).
//   WHILE THEY STAND   a man whose way has since become known floor (Sam went through it) moves his GUN — never his feet — to a heavier thing no mate is
//                 on, if he has a line to it from where he stands (asked once a second, and weighed again only when a room has become known, a leaf of
//                 the space has moved, or a mate's deal has come or gone).
//
// The seam is three lines of orders.ts's 'move' (issue hands each man a Fit; tick calls fitTick). ROOMFIT.on false (?noroomfit): fitSpots answers null and the
// order is the line abreast, frame for frame. Nothing here draws dice, reads the camera or the renderer, or keeps state outside the man's own Assignment
// (orders are in no checkpoint, so neither is this). (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
