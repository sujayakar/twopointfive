// SHAKEN — THE FIRST SLICE OF THE ENEMY'S MORALE (the maintainer, 10-13, a Mousehole room clear on hard, alone: "we could model something like morale or
// psychological state or fear … when a guy is by himself in the dark and i blow open the door to his room with HE, he's probably not in a good place" — and
// "a lot of the value from this comes with good telegraphing": he SAYS it, then he DOES it, with a beat the player can act on).
//
// The man in that replay said "they've blown the wall!", turned eleven degrees and stood upright on the same spot, silent, for twenty seconds.
//   · ONE NUMBER A MAN, `dread` 0‥1 = shock + standing, read as three RUNGS with hysteresis: 0 steady · 1 jumpy · 2 broken. Behaviour keys off the rung alone.
//     FEEDS ADD TO DREAD, RUNGS DRIVE BEHAVIOUR: later slices bring more feeds (a radio check nobody answers, a body found, the lights dying) and touch nothing
//     below the rungs.
//   · SHOCK is what events add, up to `shockCap`; it halves every `halfLife` seconds. This slice's one feed is a BLAST (moraleBlast: frag.ts blast — a frag,
//     the 40 mm —, the door charge, the wall charge): every living hostile man inside `blastM` of it with a line to where it went off once it has gone (asked
//     the frame AFTER: the leaf it tore off still stands in its frame on the blast's own), or inside `nearM` whatever stands between, takes `blast` — all of it
//     inside `nearM`, down to `farK` of it at `blastM`. Never a civilian, an operative or the player; never a man of the side whose grenade it was; never a
//     choreographed man; never a man of the hostage rescue's cast (rescue.ts: any of them may be the one holding its clock).
//   · STANDING is where he is, read `askSecs` apart (each man on his own frames): + `alone` with no living mate inside `aloneM` IN HIS VIEW (a mate through a
//     wall is no company), + `dark` blind-dark where he stands (inTheDark: the place's steady light, his own lamp left out, under the meter's floor; `litAsks`
//     readings running must say lit before the dark is taken off him).
//   · BROKEN is for a man ALONE IN THE DARK only, however much shock he carries (mayBreak — the one predicate a later slice opens other routes through).
//   So: a blast makes a man jumpy; a blast on a man alone in the dark breaks him; alone in the light, or in the dark with a mate at his shoulder, jumpy.
//   · JUMPY, on a blast: he DUCKS — crouched, gun down, turned to it — through any stagger of the blast's own and `duckSecs` past it; the nearest of the men
//     who duck shouts it as they go down. Then the man he was.
//   · BROKEN, on a blast: a short sequence of his own and then a hold, by seconds counted from the END of the blast's own stagger (the blast's owners root a
//     man they folded, gun down, no round — frag.ts, doortools.ts — and nothing here moves him or fires for him before that is over) —
//       down    through the stagger and `downSecs` more: he goes down where he stands, folded;
//       back    to `backUntil`: the cracked call on the net that nobody answers, THEN he scrabbles backward off the hole, low, facing it, at `backSpeed`, up to
//               `backM` and no further than the wall or the furniture behind him;
//       burst   `burstRounds` real rounds into the dust at the hole, `spread` wide, at the place and not at anybody;
//       hold    he stays down where he stopped with his gun on the hole for as long as he is broken — and, still alone, calls again `call2Secs` on.
//     THE BAIT: holding, the first thing to cross the hole (an enemy in his sight inside `baitM` of it, or a thrown thing flying or landing there in his view)
//     gets THE REST OF HIS MAGAZINE at the hole — the gun is then really empty, by the weapon's own count — then the shout that he is out and the guards' own
//     magazine change, stretched to `reloadSecs`; a second thrown thing gets `baitShort` rounds; a third a word and no round.
//   · A REAL SIGHTING ENDS IT, for good: an enemy plainly in his eyes anywhere but at the hole — or anywhere at all once the long burst is spent — and he is
//     the fight's man again (roomfight.ts / guards.ts); he does not turn back to the hole. Nothing here touches health, aim, skill or a reaction beat: his
//     reactT runs on under the duck as under a head-down.
//   · WHO DRIVES HIM: while a sequence has him (`moraleOwns`) guards.ts runs this file's GuardScript for the frame the way it runs frag.ts's flee — his own
//     script, state and fix stand exactly as they were — and the room fight's defender tick yields. His ears are kept open (hearingCheck), his gun is out, and
//     a frame on which the floor's own rules would take him to 'alert' is left to them: he calls his CONTACT and raises what any man at that awareness raises.
// TRAINING (the maintainer, 10-13: "more poorly trained ones could get really scared"; "harder settings have better trained guys … higher morale"): every man
// is GREEN or STEADY (trainingOf — by the `training` knob, then the squad's own key in the level, then the difficulty: MORALE_AT), and it moves two things only,
// where his rungs sit and how he copes:
//   · a STEADY man is the man above in WHEN he breaks (alone and in the dark, at `broken`), and copes trained: down to a crouch, not folded; back off the hole
//     facing it; a flat call on the net; NO burst into the dust; then low on the hole — and a bait draws `baitShort` rounds, never the magazine: he is never dry.
//   · a GREEN man breaks ALONE, lit or dark, and at `greenBroken`; his sequence is the one above as written. Among his mates he ducks like any man — but for
//     the ONE man of a squad its leader's fall has marked (below).
//   · THE LEADER (leaderOf: the first man of his squad — on a floor with no squads, of the men staged in his room — where that man is steady). Killed —
//     combat.ts killGuard → moraleManDown — every green man of his has the standing term `leaderDown` from then on, and the ones with the fall in their eyes
//     `leaderShock` on top (sawLeaderFall: seconds since) and a FLINCH: down for `flinchSecs` facing where he fell, then up. The NEAREST of them says so,
//     spoken, on that frame — one line a squad a death — and is the one man of it a later blast may break with his mates about him; the rest duck and fight.
//   · A LEADER NEVER DUCKS, whatever the mix: fed by a blast he stands, his gun onto the hole, one side step off its line where the floor is free. With men of
//     his ducked inside `orderM` of him and a line between them he gives the order, spoken, `orderBeat` after any stagger; their duck ends `orderSecs` after
//     it (a breath apart, the nearest answering), not after its whole time. A steady man's duck is `steadyDuck`, short of a green man's `duckSecs`: the
//     trained are up first. That is the telegraph of who is who.
//   · NO BREAK IS FOR EVER: rung 2 is held only while more than `holdShock` of shock is on him, and a broken man's sequence lets him go `holdMax` seconds in.
//   · `nerve` (brittle / normal / steady) scales every shock a man takes by `nerveK` (steady: a lone green man in a LIT room is under his line to one blast —
//     on purpose, that is what steady nerve buys).
//   No health, aim, skill or reaction table is read or written by any of it. `training: 'none'` = no training at all, every man the first slice's (what a
//   recording from before the key replays with).
// SHOW, NOT TELL: nothing is drawn or written for the player but the man himself. One die (simRandom), no wall clock, no graphics setting; the clocks are seconds
// COUNTED and ride a checkpoint with the rest (moraleSnapshot / Restore).
// The switch is off in the module and on the frozen stand: every seam returns on its first line, no man is met, no die is drawn — the build as it was.
// Type-only game imports but for the functions below, used inside calls only (src/game is one import cycle).
