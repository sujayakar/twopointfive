// A BLAST IN THE SNOW (SNOW_LOOK.blast; ?snowblast=0, TPS_SNOWBLAST=1) — picture only.
//
// The maintainer, playing the snow level on his GPU (10-15): "grenades/he don't seem to really affect snow". They did not: a frag left its scorch and its smoke,
// and the snow it went off in lay as it fell. His standing notes bind what a blast must be here: "the control approach" (one event told at every grain size,
// from the chunks down to the dust) and "should really feel explosive and bang things around. both the explosion and shock wave".
//
// What one blast over lying snow now does, each a layer the level already had:
//   · THE CRATER — into the prints' map (snowTracks.ts pressCrater): a blown-out pan with a ragged lip, scoured rays, clods thrown about it. The big pieces.
//   · THE DIG    — where snow STANDS (a drift's hill, a bank against a wall: render/snowField.ts, baked once) the blast digs it out to the ground, or to
//                  whatever of it still stands solid (digSnowField). A charge that cuts a hole in a wall no longer leaves the bank drawn across the hole.
//   · THE THROW  — the loose snow about it goes up and out as a burst of the near GRAINS (particles.wgsl grainStep reads grain.c / .d: for a few frames a share
//                  of every lying grain is the blast's). The fine pieces.
//   · THE PUFF   — a ring of powder low over the ground, as wisp records with no gust length (particles.wgsl puffRec). The dust.
//   · THE AIR    — a short hard radial shove to the wind's simulation (airSim.ts airPuff): the blown snow already in the air is driven off the blast and curls
//                  back round whatever it meets. The shock wave, as the snow shows it.
// Every blast that goes through the destruction engine's feed is told (g.destr.onBlast: a frag, an HE round, a charge on a wall or a door) — nothing here asks
// what threw it. Nothing here is read by the game: no die of the game's is rolled (the crater's shape is hashed off where it is and which it was), no sense, no
// path, no sound. Off = the snow as it was: nothing subscribes, nothing is stamped or filed.
//
// NEVER SEEN ON A GPU, never seen moving (the cloud has neither): every number below is a first guess for the maintainer's eye — `__snow.blast` on the console.
