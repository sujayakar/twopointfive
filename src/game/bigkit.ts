// THE BIG SLOT'S TOOLS ON A DOOR (the maintainer, 10-14: "i do think we should change the breaching shotgun to not take up a primary weapon slot (ready or
// not and door kickers have it as a separate slot, like the wall charge) since its slugs are only effective on door hinges anyways" · "and then we should
// also add a dynamic hammer"). The switch, the card's row and the numbers are kit.ts's (`BIGSLOT`); with it off nothing here runs — no row is offered, no
// man carries either thing (kit.ts kitBig, Player.bigKit stay 'none').
//
//   THE BREACHING SHOTGUN IS KIT. Carried in the big slot it is nobody's gun: a man keeps his rifle or his pistol, and the M870 comes out for a LOCK and
//   nothing else. What it does to the lock is shotgun.ts's own rule (fireShell: enough of one shell into a latched, locked leaf by its latch edge from
//   close, and the keep is gone — doors.ts kickIn with `lock`, so from the face the leaf opens toward it stands home unlocked for a hand to pull; a wedge
//   under the leaf is no keep and steel rings and holds). The shell is a shell: its flash, report and hearing event are the row's — heard as gunfire.
//     · YOU: a row of a door locked against you, in the boot's place ('shoot the lock off'). One committed beat (Player.kick with `tool`): planted on the
//       boot's spot, `BIGSLOT.draw` seconds to bring it up, a shell at the lock; a lock that holds gets up to `BIGSLOT.shells` of them.
//     · A TEAMMATE: the door tools' own lock-shooting (doortools.ts toGun / gunStep, written for a man whose GUN was the shotgun) with the gun brought up
//       off its sling as he comes onto his spot (gunUp: his own gun put down for it, `BIGSLOT.draw` seconds before the shell) and slung again the moment
//       the lock is off, the gun is given up on, or the fight has him (gunDown — doortools.ts slingTick is the net under every other way out).
//
//   THE DYNAMIC HAMMER. ONE blow where a boot would do (the leaf opens away from him: never slower than the boot), `BIGSLOT.swings` blows, one every
//   `BIGSLOT.swing` seconds, where the frame holds a boot (bigkit.ts hammerBlows) — and the lock gives: the last blow is doors.ts kickIn with `lock` — the
//   boot's verb and the boot's noise (a 'kick' the whole floor hears, never a shot), from EITHER face: where the frame holds a boot (the face the leaf
//   opens toward) the keep is broken out and the leaf stands home for a hand, as after the shotgun. It takes a wedged door too (the shotgun does not);
//   steel still holds. The blows before the last are the frame taking it: a thud each.
//     · YOU: the same row and the same beat ('hammer it open').
//     · A TEAMMATE: the door tools' lock stage again (toGun picks the man — a shotgun first, where the lock is one it takes — and hammerStep swings).
//
//   THE MOVES (BIGSLOT.moves — the maintainer, 10-15, with Door Kickers 2 footage: "i think the dynamic hammer and shotgun animations / pathing need some
//   work" · "using the hammer shouldn't require being directly in front of the door?" · "the character should have a hammer on their back, they put away
//   their gun, equip the hammer, wind up, and then hit the door in one motion"). What the build before did at the clinic's ward door with the four stacked
//   on it: the row was offered only inside the hand's reach of the leaf (doors.ts USE_REACH, 1.35 m of its middle — nothing from the stack's file), and the
//   one place beside the frame it knew (the latch jamb, kickSpotSide) was the lead's own mark, so he was slid to the boot's spot square in the opening.
//     · WHERE (bigSpots): a list of places for the man with the tool, best first — hard by the latch jamb, then (on the face the leaf opens away from) by
//       the hinge jamb, then off the shoulder of a man who has the jamb — every one of them OUT of the opening; the shotgun's a short arm nearer the lock
//       than its pattern needs. The first with floor, a line to the leaf and nobody standing on it is his. A teammate's list is the same one (shotgun.ts
//       breachSpot asks it first).
//     · YOU: the row is yours from BIGSLOT.reach of the doorway while such a place can be walked to in a straight line, and he WALKS there (samBigWalk) with
//       the tool coming into his hands on the way; the boot's spot in the opening only where nothing beside the frame has floor, and only from the hand's reach.
//     · THE BEAT: his gun put away and the tool in both hands in BIGSLOT.equip s (the shotgun's BIGSLOT.draw), each blow wound up over BIGSLOT.windup s and
//       landed in one swing, BIGSLOT.stow s to put it back. The body's side of it is the animator's (character.ts bigTool — a pose that is a pure function
//       of the beat's clock, written here every frame: samBigPose, hammerOutTick), the hammer on a back or in the hands is rigProps.ts's.
//   Off (`?nobigmoves`, a recording from before the key): the row inside the hand's reach, the one place or the opening, the punch standing in.
// NOBODY HAS SEEN ANY OF IT ON A GPU. With the moves off neither thing is drawn in your hands (a teammate's shotgun is, being a gun in his hands for the
// beat) and the hammer's blow is the strike a takedown uses, standing in.
// No dice, no camera, nothing read off the renderer. State: Player.kick.tool (a committed beat: savestate.ts refuses a save while a kick runs) and
// Guard.slung (on the man: the frame after a load slingTick finds him with no lock to shoot and gives him his own gun back).
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
