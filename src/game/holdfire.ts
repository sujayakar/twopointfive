// HOLDFIRE — a squad nobody has found never fires first.
//
// The play note: "an unfound squad never fires first: your shot or your order starts the fight, walking or sneaking" · "while nobody has found the squad,
// nobody fires until you do or you order it, whatever your posture". Until this file a LOUD squad held its fire on a man who had not noticed it only while
// Sam SNEAKED (unseen.ts's hold); walking in tall with the team behind him, the first teammate with a line shot the first man he saw.
//
// THE RULE: while nobody has FOUND the squad (this file's own test, `found` below: nothing loud in a teammate's ears inside the room fight's hot clock, and no
// defender alert or searching WHO HAS HAD EYES ON THE TEAM — `Guard.lastSeenT`, the stamp perception sets at a real sighting, the licence to shoot. A defender
// who is 'alert' only because he planted at the end of a walk, dug in on boots or stood to on a noise, and has seen nobody, has not found anybody: unseen.ts's
// `squadFound` counts him, this rule does not), a teammate's round at a man who has not noticed anybody is HELD — the gun goes onto him and stays there, the sneak hold's own line — whatever
// Sam's posture. THE FIGHT STARTS, for everybody at once, with
//   his shot      a ROUND from a player's gun, any gun, suppressed too (combat.ts fireWeapon → holdFireShot). NOT his ring / sponge round (launcher.ts
//                 fireRing: his quiet tool, like a takedown — it lifts nothing); the 40 mm HE lifts at its BURST, through the loud event in the team's ears.
//   his order     an order that means fire (LIFT_ORDERS by id: every door tool, the word, a frag / stun thrown on order — orders.ts give → holdFireOrder;
//                 the night breach's F 'go' — nightbreach.ts order), for `liftSecs` after the last of them and for as long as a door order of the squad is
//                 being WORKED (doortools.ts / wallcharge.ts ops, the F drill going in) or a hostage rescue is on the clock (rescue.ts `dynamic`).
//                 AN ORDER THAT WAITS LIFTS NOTHING UNTIL IT GOES: a tool given 'on my word' lifts at the WORD ('go' / F), not at the give, and its op
//                 does not count as worked while it waits; a charge (door or wall) lifts at the BLOW — set, stood off and armed it is a squad waiting.
//                 A plain stack never lifts. A threshold order (the door opened, held from outside) lifts at the give unless it was given on the word.
//                 'GO LOUD', TOLD TO A SILENT SQUAD, IS SUCH AN ORDER (HOLDFIRE.loud; the maintainer, 10-13: "loud" itself means weapons free "only for a squad
//                 that was silent and is told loud"): the menu's row, given by him while they are silent (orders.ts give asks `holdFireSilent` before the row
//                 is issued and says so here). Not a squad that starts loud, not 'loud' told to a loud squad, not silence ended any other way (a loud
//                 tool's row is its own order above; a new cast, the panel: nothing). WHILE THAT LIFT STANDS (`liftSecs` from the order: its own stamp,
//                 `loudT`) THE SNEAK'S HOLD HOLDS NOBODY EITHER (silent.ts asks `holdFireLoud` in front of unseen.ts's answer, plain and through glass):
//                 Sam is usually low when he says it. No other lift touches the sneak's hold.
//   being found   `found`: a shot, a charge or a boot in any teammate's ears, a roused defender who has seen them. FOUND MEANS FOUND: nobody holds a frame longer.
// and one man's round is never held on a man who HAS noticed (the silent order's own bar, awareness ≥ SILENT.noticed), nor while a captor is at his last
// warning. With the floor calm again and the lift run out, the hold is back.
// WITH THIS ON, `?sneakfire` (UNSEEN.hold off) alone no longer makes a sneaking squad shoot on sight — this hold answers when the sneak's does not; it takes
// `?noholdfire` too. And a QUIET gun is held as well (HOLDFIRE.quiet), which the sneak's hold never did.
// NOT here: a SILENT squad (silent.ts's own hold is the silent man's rule — this file answers only for a loud one) · the squad sneaking with Sam under
// UNSEEN.hold (unseen.ts answers first and keeps its own count; only holds that are NEW because of this rule are counted below) · defenders · Sam.
//
// OFF (the module's default and the frozen harness stand; TPS_HOLDFIRE=1 raises it; the page raises it, `?noholdfire` = off for the visit): every function
// returns on its first line and the game is the build before it.
// Habits: no dice · reads no camera, canvas or graphics setting · `leadOf` is the one place that says which player's squad · state is per Game in a WeakMap
// with a snapshot / restore pair below (no checkpoint is taken with a unit on the floor today, so savestate.ts does not carry it yet).
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
