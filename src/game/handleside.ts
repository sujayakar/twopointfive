// THE HANDLE SIDE: an AI man who opens a door first gets to its HANDLE jamb on his own face of it and works it from there. The maintainer, 10-08: "doors could
// use some work too … open has to be on the handle side for AI". Measured on the build before this file (tools/qa/handle-watch.ts over the loud levels): a man
// on foot walked at the middle of the leaf and opened it with his body wherever his path met it — and on the face a one-way leaf opens INTO (doors.ts DOORWAY:
// the pull face) that leaf then came round THROUGH him (Door.pullT: the pass-through the one-way doors left for this file to end); a stack with no floor at
// the latch jamb shoved the leaf from the hinge jamb, a leaf's length from its handle.
// Three rules, for every man of the AI on foot — the squad, the defenders, the night's staff and the QRF alike; the PLAYER is not bound by any of it:
//   PUSH  (handleGate, asked by followPath / the scripted strafe): the walk of a man whose way goes through a leaf standing in it, on the face it opens AWAY
//         from, is bent to the handle half of the frame (`pushIn` in from the latch jamb) and, a stride short, his feet are put on that line: his hand meets
//         the leaf by its handle, not by its hinge.
//   PULL  (the same gate): on the face it opens INTO he leaves his walk a few metres short, goes to a place BESIDE THE LATCH JAMB — within `reach` of the
//         handle and clear of everything the leaf sweeps (doors.swingOf(d).sweeps, with his body's radius) — turns to the handle, pulls the leaf round past
//         himself (it does not touch him: he is not where it swings) and walks on once it stands clear. One man has a door at a time; a man of his whose own
//         walk would take him into that swing meanwhile stops short of it. A door hard in a corner — no floor beside its latch jamb — is pulled at the
//         LONG REACH: from the nearest floor in front of its handle half that its leaf does not sweep (up to `farReach` from the handle: an arm and a
//         lean — a place the leaf would come round through is no place). No floor even for that: he opens it as he did before (HANDLE_STATS.noSpot).
//   TOOLS (toolSpot, asked by doortools.ts when a door order's lead is about to open the door by hand): the lead who is not at the handle — a stack filed on
//         the hinge jamb, a jamb mark out of reach, or standing where the leaf will come round — steps to the handle's place first and shoves it from there
//         (the walk the boot's own man makes to his kick spot, and the same way back onto his jamb).
//         A SQUAD DOOR ORDER'S lead, on the face the leaf opens away from (HANDLE.toolNear, nearStand): that place is in the middle of the opening, on the
//         line of every gun in the room — he steps toward the handle only as far as his arm needs and keeps his body past the latch jamb.
// A KICK is taken from where the kick already stands (by the lock: doors.ts kickSpot); a door off its hinges, one standing open, one locked against the man
// and one somebody is already swinging are nobody's to work. Nothing here runs with the one-way doors off (DOORWAY.oneWay — the harness's frozen runs), under
// a showcase (Game.touring: its men are choreographed), or with HANDLE.on off: the build as it was, digest for digest.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
