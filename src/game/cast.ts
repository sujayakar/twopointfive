// WHO WEARS WHAT — the cast (anim/gltf.ts loadGltfCast: the character mesh as PARTS, a VARIANT = the parts one man wears). The meshes say which variants exist and which side each is
// for; this says which man gets which, and it is the only place that does:
//   Sam                         the first operator variant
//   his side's AI (operative)   the other operator variants, by id (a four are four different men while the cast has four to give)
//   the staff and the hostiles  the defender variants, by id
//   the response element        the responder variants, by id (Guard.trained: the QRF and its perimeter tier — staff, but a drilled element in ONE outfit, neither the
//                               operators' kit nor the irregulars' hats; a cast with none: the defenders')
//   civilians and hostages      the civilian variants, by id (a cast with none: the defenders' — never an operator's kit)
// + THE GOGGLES: an operator variant lists `nvg_up` (a cast may also carry `nvg_down`; this one does not: it was never drawn), but whether a man has goggles, and whether they are down, is the GAME's to say (Sam's N key, nvg.ts for a
//   teammate) and the game already draws them: rigProps' goggle boxes (the issue kit's two dark tubes, or the old kit's three lit lenses: gear.ts). So castParts() takes both mesh goggles off a man the game draws goggles on (nothing
//   doubles), and leaves a man the game gives none the mesh pair flipped UP on his helmet mount — kit he carries, never down and dark over his eyes.
// Looks only: nothing in the simulation reads a variant (the CPU's hit capsules, the wet model and the ragdoll are the skeleton's), no dice are drawn, and with no cast loaded
// (the mannequin: `?mannequin`, the QA harness, the native host under `--mannequin` / `TPS_MANNEQUIN=1` or with a dylib that does not draw the cast) every man's mask is 0 and he is drawn exactly as he always was. The choice is taken once per Character, the
// first time the game knows his side.
