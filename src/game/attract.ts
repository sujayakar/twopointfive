// the conference glass, the server room's glow, the break room and its fire exit — holding each for a few seconds with a breath of yaw drift and a slow

// shot and out of the AI's senses. The first key, click, wheel tick or real mouse movement puts everything back at once (no fade): a fresh encounter exactly as
// the Start button has always found it (restartEncounter: the men on their marks, doors, props and switches as authored, Sam at the insertion point), the
// camera back on him at its own yaw and height, the flags as they were — and the idle clock starts again. main.ts decides WHEN it may run at all (its canRun:
// the start card only, no tour, auto quality done calibrating, never under ?paused / automation / a hidden tab); this file is the programme itself.
// Two stages once it starts: the OPENING (`active`, not yet `live`) only raises the veil over the card's own still view — the world stays frozen and untouched
// under it (main.ts keys its freeze on `live`) — and only once the veil has been fully black for a presented frame does it go LIVE: the flags up, Sam away, the
// world let go and the first cut, all unseen. A poke during the opening therefore has nothing to put back but the veil.
