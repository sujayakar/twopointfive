// A CALM GUARD BURNS HIS TORCH ONLY WHERE HE NEEDS IT (the maintainer, 10-10, the solo night at dusk: "seems a little odd to have guards walking around with
// flashlights when it's peaceful and the office worker is doing stuff").
//
// The shift used to walk its beats with the hand torch burning wherever it went — under the cubicles' ceiling panels, down the lit corridor, past the late worker at
// his desk. Now a staff man on a CALM patrol still carries it (rigProps draws it in his hand either way) but the light is off while the place he is in and the floor
// he is walking onto are lit enough to work in, and clicks on when he walks into real dark: a dark room at night, the lobby with its lamps out, a blackout, the patch
// under a fixture somebody shot out.
//   · LIT ENOUGH TO WORK IN = the place's own STEADY light (fixtures, lamps, screens, the hour's sun and sky — guards.ts lightEstimateAt with nothing anybody carries
//     counted and no flash, tracer, stroke of lightning or turning beacon) reads `litAt` or over at him OR on floor he has a line to within `spillM`: the estimate is
//     direct light only, and a pool of light a few strides off in plain view is what lights the gap between two fixtures on screen (the bounce); by day, floor the
//     sun or the sky lights counts from `dayM` off, through glass (a window is a far bigger lamp than a ceiling panel). The same is asked of the floor `aheadM` / 2
//     and `aheadM` along the way he faces, as far as the first wall.
//   · A DWELL keeps it from blinking at a pool's edge: on after `onSecs` of dark (quickly: he stands in it, or his next strides are), off after `offSecs` of floor
//     lit — at `offK` × the bar — all the way down his look; between the two readings the torch stays as it is, and no two clicks come inside `holdSecs`. The clocks
//     are seconds COUNTED, not stamps against Game.time (a checkpoint puts that clock back), and ride a checkpoint with the reading (calmTorchSnapshot / Restore).
//   · ONE MODEL: his torch is one of the lights the meter reads — Sam's, a body's — so a lit room loses a sweeping beam and a dark one keeps it. Nothing is added on the
//     AI side: no eye, ear or rule of his reads this file.
//   · EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT CALM IS AS IT WAS: the rule is asked only of a staff man whose hand holds the torch on a plain patrol (guards.ts handCarry 'torch' and
//     state 'patrol') with nothing on his mind — awareness under `calmAw`, no errand, no body duty. A whistle he is answering (suspicious, torch kept in hand), a
//     glimpse that has his attention, the walk to the breaker: burning. Drawn pistols, weapon lights, units, the QRF, teammates: not this file's. Never under a show
//     (the tour and the showcases are choreographed round the beams) or quietUtility.
// No dice, no camera, no graphics setting: the estimate is the CPU's, the same on every host.
// Type-only game imports but for guards.ts's two functions, used inside calls only (src/game is one import cycle).
