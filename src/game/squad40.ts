// A TEAMMATE'S 40 mm GRENADE, FIRED ON ORDER — "40 mm there".
//
// The maintainer, on the gear screen (10-19): "should be symmetric between self and teammates (e.g. 40mm should work for squad)". Until here the launcher's
// high-explosive round was Sam's alone (he40.ts: "nobody else is handed one"). Here a teammate's card may carry rounds (kit.ts MemberKit.shells, staged by
// kitStage) and the squad has one counted order on a spot of FLOOR, on the throws' own page of the floor's menu (squadthrow.ts):
//
//   X on a spot of floor · G ('throw ▸') · 3 = 40 mm there.      Nothing held, no digit above 3 on the page.
//
// THE ROUND is he40.ts's and nothing else: fireShell off the teammate's own launcher, the same 76 m/s, the same nose fuze that arms HE40.armM out, the same
// burst (frag.ts blast) — on whoever stands in it, his own side and the player too. Nothing here judges anybody or draws a die.
// THE COUNT is each man's own: what his card carries rides in his pouches and goes down his tube, so a man with none fires none whoever else has one, and a
// man down takes his with him. The row and the squad block show what the men on their feet have between them.
// WHO FIRES: of the men the menu goes to, one with a round, a long gun in his hands that has the launcher under it (weapons.ts `launcher`), a hand free
// (squadsmoke.ts squadHandFree, squadthrow.ts handsBusy), the tube closed again after his last (LAUNCHER40.cd), and A SHOT: the arc he40.ts would fly from
// his tube to the spot (shellSolve — statics, leaves, furniture, the bodies a round stops on: the player, the unarmed, the other side — and, to the plan, a
// teammate: nobody fires one through a friend's back) goes off within
// `nearM` of the spot and is ARMED there, a margin over (`armSlack`). A man of the other side standing in the line is where it goes off instead — if it is
// armed there. A man whose gun is on the spot already is asked first, then the nearest.
// HE POINTS IT FIRST. A man whose gun is UP and on the spot (within `aimRad`: in a fight, or under an order that has it at his shoulder) fires at once and
// keeps whatever he was doing — the fight included. Another is turned
// to it: lent from his order as a walking thrower is (squadthrow.ts squadLend — only a man who may be: no drill, door tool or fight has him), gun up on the
// spot, and the round goes when his gun is on it and the floor still says yes; then he is handed back (squadHandBack). NOBODY WALKS for it and nobody runs.
// SENSE, asked when the menu is read and again as the round goes (nothing is spent on a refusal): none left · none with the men addressed · nobody of them
// ready (no launcher in a free hand, the tube still open, not ours to turn) · too close to arm · no shot for anybody addressed · NEVER ONTO ITS OWN: the
// player, a teammate still breathing (the man firing too), a hostage, the man to take alive or a civilian inside the burst's reach (FRAG.woundM and
// `reachSlack`, by squadthrow.ts squadFragCatches with nobody counted on to duck: it goes off as it lands) of where it goes off or of the spot = refused,
// naming who. A man whose round would have one of ours in it is passed over for the next man with a shot.
// A SILENT squad: the row is one of silent.ts LOUD_ROWS (marked, and giving it takes the squad out of silent) and of holdfire.ts LIFT_ORDERS.
//
// SQUAD40.on: off in the module and on the frozen stand; on in the page (host/profile.ts; `?nosquad40`). The row is on the menu only while the switch is on,
// the throws' page is there (squadthrow.ts: no page, no row) AND this staging's cards brought a round: with no card carrying one nothing is kept for the Game, nothing is registered, nothing runs but one map read a
// frame, and a run digests as it did before this file — on either stand. `SQUAD40_BREAK=1` (the check's): the switch reads off whatever it is set to.
//
// State is per Game in a side table: each man's rounds, his last shot, who is turning to one, what the squad block shows. None of it is in a checkpoint —
// none is taken with a unit on the floor. Check: tools/qa/squad40-check.ts (`probes.ts squad40`).
