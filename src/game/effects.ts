// The graded visual effects, as numbers and as the code that spawns them: the shot (bore jet, side ports, lingering wisp, powder sparks,
// warm flash), the stun canister going off on the floor (end jets + body vents, wisp, incandescent fragments with smoke trails, white
// flash) and the smoke can's floor-hugging vent. Ported from twopointfive's src/game/effects.ts (blocks `muzzle`, `burst`, `flash`,
// `sparks`, `trail`, `vent`, tuning history 26df598..13ba1b8) onto this project's SmokeSystem emitters, transient lights and box sparks.
//
// EVERY TUNED NUMBER LIVES HERE so the set can be graded in one place; game.ts / sparks.ts / the panel only read it. Values are in OUR
// units — what the solver and renderer actually receive — with the reference value in the trailing "ref" note. The conversions applied:
//
//   quantity              theirs → ours     why
//   density rate (/s)     × 0.09            optical equivalence: their tracer draws σt = 0.55/m per density unit, our march uses 6/m per unit
//                                           (volumetrics.wgsl `dens * 6.0`), 0.55/6 = 0.092. Cross-check: the ported shot deposits ~7.8e-3
//                                           unit·m³ of smoke against ~9.1e-3 for the hand-tuned puff it replaces — same league, by a different road.
//   temperature rate (/s) × 1.5             equal buoyant impulse per deposited unit: their tuning page ran buoyancy 6.0 m/s² per unit cooling at
//                                           3/s (2 m/s per unit); ours is 1.6 m/s² per unit decaying at 1.2/s (1.33 m/s per unit)
//   jet speed (m/s)       × 0.5, ≤ 8        our forces kernel clamps |u| at 8 m/s and a fine domain is 1.4 m across (64 × 2.2 cm) (theirs: 4 m box); halving
//                                           keeps the bore : port : wisp ratios instead of flattening everything against the clamp
//   push (1/s), expand (1/s), attack / life (s)   1 : 1    same semantics after the solver port (smoke.wgsl: per-emitter push, sourceExpansion)
//   splat radius (m)      × 0.6             their splat is (1−r²/R²)² with compact support R (half-max at 0.54 R, volume 0.96 R³); ours is
//                                           exp(−r²/R²) cut at 3R (half-max 0.83 R, volume 5.57 R³). Matching the half-max radius says 0.65,
//                                           matching deposited volume says 0.556 — 0.6 splits them. Then floored per lattice where a splat would
//                                           fall under one cell (their own "honest lie": the shape survives, the scale does not)
//   effect-internal lengths (standoff, can half-length)   × 0.6   with the radii, so proportions survive
//   lattice               3.125 cm theirs;  shot → our fine 2.2 cm domains (bore jet 3.6 cells, wisp 1.9 — their "two cells across"),
//                                           canister effects → our coarse 5.5 cm domains (burst core 4.2 cells, trails floored to 1 cell)
//   light power           not derivable     (their raymarch takes power/d² at its own exposure); set against what was here: the old muzzle pair
//                                           summed to 92 × 0.45 for the player, torches are 55–70, and a stun charge should out-blast all of it
//   spark kinematics      1 : 1             metres and seconds, no lattice involved; only the COUNTS shrink (they are boxes here, pool of 96)
//
// What could not be checked from here (no GPU in the loop): whether × 1.5 heat reads as "lifts on its own" or as "boils" in a 1.6 m tall
// fine box, and whether 600 for 0.14 s is a stun charge or a camera flash under AgX — hence the gains below and the Effects panel section.
