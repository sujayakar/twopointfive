// CLEARED ROOMS (Game.cleared, __game.cleared) — which rooms the team has been in, for the WAY a teammate walks to where an order sends him.
// the maintainer, 10-08, playing the warehouse with the four: "sometimes they will (1) not all go through the door when clearing (they'll route to the room through
// a different door) and then (2) even worse they'll go through uncleared rooms to get there!" Every ordered walk was the nav grid's SHORTEST way, and the
// squad of four stacked on whichever face of a door its men could walk to soonest (orders.ts sideFor) — with doors standing open after a fight, that was
// often the face INSIDE the room the order was for, reached through its other door, or a short cut through a room next to it.
//
//   A ROOM       the room fight's own (roomfight.ts roomAt): the nav cells reachable from one another without crossing a doorway cell — flooded here on this
//                module's own books (the room fight's ids and merges depend on the order rooms are asked for; nothing here touches them). A flood past
//                ROOM_MAX_CELLS is open floor, not a room: never 'uncleared'. Nothing authored: a new level has its rooms for nothing.
//   KNOWN        one of the team — a teammate, or Sam — has STOOD in it this encounter (asked four times a second; a man in a doorway is in neither room).
//                Where Sam walks is his own call, and what he has walked through his men will walk through. Kept for the encounter (Game.resetGuards
//                forgets it; a checkpoint does not carry it: after a load the rooms the team stands in are known and the rest are learnt again).
//   THE RULE     orders.ts asks three things of it, each one switch (ORDERS.cleared / knownFace / ownDoor), each off = the build as it was:
//                · route(): a walk to a mark is priced with every cell of a room that is not known `ORDERS.clearedDear` times dearer — he goes ROUND by known
//                  floor where there is a way round. The room his mark is in and the room he stands in are never dear (the first is the order itself). With
//                  no way round he goes through, as before: an order is never refused for it.
//                · sideFor(): a door order is stacked on the face whose floor is KNOWN when the other face's is not, whatever the men's walks come to.
//                · the entry (doortools.ts): a man sent to his point inside goes THROUGH THE ORDERED DOOR — one who is not at it when the word comes (the fight
//                  had him, he was late to the stack) is walked to its mouth by known floor first, never in by the room's other door.
// With no operative on the floor nothing here runs. (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
