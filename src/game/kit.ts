// EACH MEMBER'S KIT AND UNIFORM (the maintainer, 10-07: "tweaking their kit and uniform and all that could be cool. think like mgsv did!"): one small table —
// KIT.members[i], 0 = you, 1 to 4 = the teammates in the order a scenario stages them — of what each brings to a run and what he wears, kept per machine
// (localStorage twopointsix.kit), changed on a card per member (ui/kitCard.ts) and put on the men where a scenario stages its team (kitStage: one call at the
// end of nightbreach.ts stage() — the night breach and the room clear — and of rescue.ts's staging).
//
// ONLY WHAT THE GAME ALREADY HAS. Every row is a thing the code could already do, picked per man:
//   weapon + suppressed   the four rows of weapons.ts a man can be handed: rifle = the FN2000 (suppressed) or the AKS-74U (bare); pistol = the Five-seveN
//                         (suppressed — the one gun the hearing model does not take for gunfire: its report is level 0.6) or the 9 mm (bare). You: 'rifle' is
//                         the FN2000 with the Five-seveN on the thigh, 'pistol' the Five-seveN alone (Player.hasRifle); both of yours are suppressed.
//                         'shotgun' (gear, 10-08 — shotgun.ts) is the M870 breaching shotgun in the rifle's place, for a teammate and for you (yours rides in
//                         slot 2 with the Five-seveN on the thigh): nine pellets a shell, a man down at room range, a lock off its door; never suppressed.
//   light                 a weapon light FITTED (teammates). None: his light is never lit, whatever the light rule, an order or the fight would burn it for
//                         (the housing is still drawn on the gun, dark: rigProps.ts has no gun without one).
//   nvg                   night-vision goggles WORN (teammates; nvg.ts). None: no tube, never 'dark' — his light, if he has one, is the light rule's alone.
//   bangs / charges       what a teammate brings to the squad's counted stun canisters and door charges (doortools.ts): the pool is what the men who come
//                         carry (kitPool) — with every card as issued and two or more coming it is DOORTOOLS.bangs / .charges exactly, whatever those knobs
//                         say; one man alone brings his own two and one.
//   smoke (a teammate)    the smoke canisters he brings to the squad's count for the order 'smoke there', on a spot of floor (squadsmoke.ts; kitSmokes).
//                         None as issued: with no card carrying one the order is not on the menu and nothing of it runs.
//   smoke / bangs         you: your own smoke and stun canisters (Player.canisters / .flashbangs), counted rows under the pouches rule (one of each as
//                         issued); with that rule off (?noslots) the one 'Cans' row of the build before it: four fixed splits of six.
//   suit / trim           the mannequin's two colours (Character.tint: the suit; tint2: its joints). Looks only — nobody's eyes read a colour.
// POUCHES (10-08, the maintainer: "door kickers 2 balanced it pretty well where the wall charge took a full slot that could otherwise be used for multiple door
// charges … same goes for flash bangs, smoke grenades, frag grenades, dynamic hammer, etc."): what a man carries of the breaching tools and the throwables
// comes out of HIS pouches — and, where the table sets one, what the teammates carry between them out of the SQUAD's (slots.json v7 sets none: the
// maintainer, 10-11, "feels weird that there's a limit on the whole squad when individuals have free pouches"; `squad.pouches` a number = the shared limit back). The numbers are DATA, in one place: slots.json beside this
// file, the balance's table as it wrote it (SLOTS.table; slotsSet swaps it) — each man's pouches, the squad's, what one of each tool costs, the most a man
// and a squad may carry, the named loadouts. A row cannot be stepped past either budget (kitPeek / kitTry say why), the sets are legal fills (the table's
// own loadouts), a saved kit over the rule gives up what it added over the issued kit until it fits (kitFitAll). What is issued is always a legal fill — a
// table that makes it not one is refused whole — so the rule moves nothing in a run until a card is changed. SLOTS.on false (?noslots) = the free rows of
// the build before. The squad's budget is counted over the teammates WHO COME (`team`, kitTeam): the loadout screen sets it as its size is stepped, the kit preview and a stored kit use all four (legal for the four is legal for any smaller team), and kitStage fits the cards to the men it stages, so no run starts over it.
// 'issued' (and every default) means HANDS OFF: that field is not written, the man is exactly what the scenario staged. So with every card as issued, or with
// KIT.on false (?nokit), nothing here touches anybody and a run digests as it did before this file — BAR YOUR OWN FOUR COUNTS UNDER THE POUCHES RULE (10-10,
// the maintainer: "sam also has an unrealistic number of pouches. we should make him symmetric with the team"): you have a teammate's four pouches and are
// issued one of each of your things — a smoke, a stun, a frag, a round of 40 mm — which is fewer than a Player is built with (BUILT below: the plain night
// with no scenario, the harness, a lesson, and your card with the rule off), so a staging under the rule writes your counts onto you (kitPlayer: whatever
// differs from what a Player is built with) and kitShow puts back what he had.
//
// THE BIG SLOT (10-14, the maintainer, over a shot of a Door Kickers 2 loadout card: "we can change the slot system to be like door kickers. you have a single
// big slot on the bottom that can fit larger kit items and then smaller pouches for other stuff" · "i do think we should change the breaching shotgun to not
// take up a primary weapon slot … since its slugs are only effective on door hinges anyways" · "and then we should also add a dynamic hammer"). ONE SWITCH,
// `BIGSLOT.on` — ON in the page (host/profile.ts pageSwitches; `?nobigslot` = the cards as they were), OFF here and on the frozen harness stand
// (`TPS_BIGSLOT=1`; a FROZEN_HOLDS row, in the knob registry and a journal's tables: a recording from before the table replays with it off). With it on:
//   · every man has ONE BIG SLOT beside his pouches (slots.json: `members[].big`, a tool's `"big": true`): the wall charge, the breaching
//     shotgun, the hammer — one of them, on ONE row of his card ('Big slot', the last: the card's bottom), and none of them costs a pouch any more.
//   · THE BREACHING SHOTGUN IS KIT, not a gun: the weapon row offers the rifle and the pistol, and a card (stored, a table's loadout, a mission's issue)
//     that says weapon 'shotgun' is read as the issued gun with the shotgun in the big slot (bigHome). It is a door tool only — bigkit.ts: yours a row
//     of a door locked against you, a teammate's brought up for the lock on a door order and slung again.
//   · THE DYNAMIC HAMMER (`big: 'hammer'`) is kit for the big slot, yours and a teammate's: bigkit.ts.
// Off = the cards, the rows, the prices and the run of the build before: `big` is kept on a card, inert (no row, no price, nothing on the man).

 *  are worn (kitWorn: what the roster and a card show, and the card a staged man carries). What the squad carries between them is a sum over the men who come
 *  (kitPool), whoever holds what, so a run is the run it was (its key `more`, below, adds one canister under the Quiet kit of four). A change of one of those counts on a teammate's card is made to the cards AS WORN, and they
 *  are then cards of the player's own, kept as they stand at every size (onWorn); any other row — a gun, a look, your own card — leaves the layout alone.
 *  The big things, the wand, the guns and the looks stay on the man the kit names (but for the tools `more` lends, below). Off (the module, the frozen stand; `?nokitdeal` in the page,

 *  pouches as they were — so a locked door is theirs to take with the big slot's row. THE PAIR'S SECOND MAN, NOT ITS FIRST: the man on the lock has the
 *  tool in his hands when the door goes, and it is his mate who must be first through with a gun up (measured — menus.md: the tool on the pair's first man
 *  lost ten men in eight runs at one door where the second man's lost two); so of three, where Blue One comes alone, only Red Two is lent one.
 *  THE TOOLS ARE WORN, NEVER WRITTEN (lend, below): no card of the table
 *  or the store holds one, so a pair comes as it always did and the key off is the deal alone at once. A big thing put on that man by hand is his instead,
 *  written as ever; his slot EMPTIED by hand is marked on his card (`bare`) and stays empty until something is put in it. No named squad kit but the issue
 *  is lent one (each says what its men carry), and cards made the player's own out of such a kit keep its empty slots (the same mark).
 *  And NOBODY COMES WITH A GUN ALONE: a man the deal leaves with nothing counted is handed one stun canister more (the Quiet kit of four: its three
