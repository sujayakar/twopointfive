// THE RESCUE'S MEN CHECK IN (defenders answer the plan the team chose: the quiet way in on a hostage rescue).
//
// WHAT WAS THERE: a rescue's cast is its own (rescue.ts: a captor on a clock, a door man, a roamer or two) and none of the squads' radio check runs on it. A
// loud way in lets the roamer off to the noise and the captor shouts his clock; a man of theirs taken without a sound is missed by nobody, for as long as the
// team cares to take.
//
// THE RULE, while a rescue is staged or running and their side is calm (no man of the cast alert or searching):
//   · A RADIO CHECK every `every` seconds (the first after `first`): the captor — or, without him, the first man who can — says "radio check — sound off".
//     A man who can answer has answered. A man who is down and whom nobody of theirs saw fall has not.
//     A man down in the hostage room itself is never asked for: that room is the rescue's own (its clock, its hand-over), and nobody is walked into it.
//   · HE IS ASKED FOR BY HIS POST `askSecs` later ("the break room, sound off … the break room?" — a defender does not say the team's label for a mate:
//     dialogue.ts placeName of where he was posted), and `goSecs` after that ONE MAN GOES THERE: a roamer still on his own post first, else the door man
//     or a guard posted outside the hostage room — "nothing from the break room — one moving there!", at a walk, his boots filed for the team's ears.
//     NEVER the captor and never a man in the room with the hostages (rescue.ts: they are the clock), never a man the rescue has already let off his post
//     or Hard's crew has dealt with, never a man another rule has (powerout.ts powerOutKept: a lane, a press, a dig-in). Nobody free: "nothing from the
//     break room — nobody to spare. Stay on your doors!" and nobody moves.
//   · ON THE WAY AND AT THE POST he looks for any man of theirs who is down and not yet found, as any finder does (guards.ts bodySeen: in his view and lit
//     enough to make out — at the post he looks about him, and a body at his feet is found in any light). FOUND: "man down, the break room — they're
//     inside!", the body is counted and written down as any found body is, he is roused, the room fight's free man and the rescue's 'learned' one like
//     any man of theirs who sees a body, and this rule lets go of him. Nothing there after `waitSecs`: "nothing at the break room — he's gone!", and he
//     walks back to his own.
//   · THE MAN WHO WENT AND DID NOT COME BACK is missed at the next check like any man — asked for where he was going — and the post he never reached is
//     a question again.
//   · A ROAMER SAYS WHERE HE IS GOING: `wordSecs` before the rescue lets a roamer who has learned of the assault off his post (rescue.ts: `setSecs` after he
//     learned) he says so on their net — "heard that — moving to cover it!", or with nothing loud to go to "on my way — moving to the hostage door!" (not a
//     man with the team in his eye: his shouts are his own). When he goes is the rescue's, as it was; a noise that comes after he spoke is said when he
//     goes. HIS WORD IS KEPT: let go with a noise known and nothing of the team seen since he learned, his fix is that noise, as the rescue gives it to a
//     man who was calm — not the doorway its echo reached him through.
//   · A fight anywhere on their side, or a shot, a boot or a charge in his ears on the way: back to his post at a run, and the rule stands down while it lasts.
//     Men who went down while their side was roused are known down: nobody is asked for after a fight.
// THE CLOCK IS NOT TOUCHED: nothing here starts it, speeds it or stops it. A man walking to a post has learned nothing of the team (rescue.ts asks
// `rescueCheckOwns` before it reads his walk as that); what he SEES there is his own.
// No man is added and nobody's eyes, aim or health change; the post he walks to is his mate's own, not where the team is. No dice (the beats are the cast's
// ids), no camera, no graphics setting, no wall clock. State per Game with its pair (rescueCheckSnapshot / rescueCheckRestore through savestate.ts).
// Type-only game imports but for functions used inside calls (src/game is one import cycle).
