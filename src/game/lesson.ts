// A LESSON: the tutorial's missions (scene/scenarioList.ts LESSON_MISSIONS; first built for the seven Training levels, taken out 2026-10-23). A level file carries a `scenarios.lesson` block
// (scene/scenarios.ts LessonData): STEPS, each a line for the HUD's objective row naming the key, and a DONE-TEST read off the game's own state. The step's line
// moves on when the player has DONE the thing — never on a clock.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT: a script. It moves nobody, spawns nothing, ends nothing and writes nothing the simulation reads (a step done asks for a checkpoint: `advance`) — a lesson is READ-ONLY over the game, so the
// same keys on a lesson level play the same run with it on or off (tools/qa/lesson-gate.ts holds the two digests equal for every Training level). The level under it is a real one of
// its kind — a quiet mission (quiet.ts) or a room clear (roomclear.ts) — with real guards on real routes; the scenario's own objective takes the row back after
// the last step and ends the run as it always does.
//
// LIVE = the switch on (`LESSON.on`; `?nolesson` off) ∧ the level carries the block ∧ a scenario is up on it (so the plain `?levelFile=x&solo` boot of a lesson
// level is that level's plain night, no lines) ∧ no show running. A level without the block: every entry point returns on its first line.
//
// THE TESTS (LESSON_TESTS below): plain records `{ is: '<kind>', … }`. Two families —
//   STATE, true while it holds:  in · near · flag · slot · pace · meter · stage · door · target · men · all · any, and by family —
//     hands: downed · body · calm   kit: reload · launcher · burst   squad: orderTo · stackOn · pairsOn · taken · following   doors: stacks   the quiet partner: mate
//   DEEDS, counted from the moment the step came up:  did { what: 'act:<verb>' | 'event:<kind>' | 'chron:<kind>' | 'order:<id>' | 'order:<id>@foe:<callsign>', n?, on?: '<door>' } ·
//     threw (a can, the frag, the launcher's grenade) · word (F, the squad's word, over how many doors) · pair (the quiet pair's log)
// A new kind is one row of that table (its test, and its check against the built floor for checkLesson). Per-player state is asked of `g.player` through one
// accessor here (who()), so a second player is one place to change.
//
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
