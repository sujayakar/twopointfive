// THE SNATCH: one unarmed man the team has to take ALIVE — an overlay on a level's ROOM CLEAR, switched on by the block `scenarios.snatch` in the level file
// (scene/scenarios.ts SnatchData; levels/snatch.json is the level built for it). A level without the block returns on the first line of every entry point:
// the game as it was.
//
//   WHO HE IS      a civilian of the usual make (civilians.ts spawnTarget: on Game.civilians, so his eyes and ears, his run, the door he pushes, the round that
//                  finds him and Sam's own grab are the civilians' — nothing of that is forked here). He is put on the floor at every staging of the room clear.
//   QUIET          he keeps to his marks. Gunfire or a charge in his ears (civilians.ts hear) frightens him as it does anybody, and he runs for the nearest of
//                  the block's WAYS OUT by walking (civSpots hands the civilians' own flee those). A teammate or Sam he SEES frightens him the same.
//   WHAT HE SEES  one model with everybody else's eyes: a man of the team is SEEN by him only through the civilians' own eye (civilians.ts civilianSees: its
//                  cone and range, the guards' sight gain on the light that falls on that man, over `seeRate`). A man in the dark on his way out is not
//                  seen: he runs into him. What the TEAM has of him (the challenge, the tie, 'nobody on him') is a plain line to him inside `seeM`.
//   HE GIVES UP    (hands on his head, where he stands — the civilians' complied cower, with no end to it) to a teammate or Sam within `giveUpM` with a line
//                  to him, from any side; and, running, to one who stands BETWEEN him and the way out he is running at within `haltM` (ships equal to
//                  `giveUpM`: he stops only for a man he all but runs into; raise it for a tamer man — at 9 m the covered play won 24 of 24). One who is
//                  between him and it but farther than that only TURNS him: that way out is struck off and he runs for another, or goes to ground.
//   IN HAND        hands up with one of the team within `cuffM` and a line for `cuffSecs` = TIED (the wrists-behind pose; for good). Hands up and nobody in
//                  sight for `boltSecs` = he bolts again. In Sam's arm, or put out cold by Sam's hands, is in hand too.
//   THE END        WON = every defender down (the room clear's own 'taken') with him alive and in hand. LOST = he reached a way out, or a round killed him
//                  (anybody's: `killer` says whose, for the tally). The loss fails the mission the way a civilian's death can (the down card); the room
//                  clear's own 'wiped' is Sam's, as ever.
//
// Seams: game.ts (the field; `tick` right after updateMission), mission.ts objectiveText / objectivePos (his line stands over the room clear's while he is
// loose), savestate.ts (the slice — a checkpoint is refused with a squad on the floor, so today nothing reaches it), knobs.ts, civilians.ts (civSpots, the
// tied pose, civilianSees, no 'control will ring' call and no knockout row for him), combat.ts (whose round found him), roomclear.ts (its 'structure
// taken' line says he is still loose). The enemies' decision code is not touched: the defenders do not know he
// exists, and no teammate holds his fire for him — a round through him is the team's to avoid by where it stands.
// The team = Sam and every living operative unit; with a second player it is each player's character, asked the same way (teamOf below is the one place).
