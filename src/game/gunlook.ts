// and the Glock 18) were built as rows that are felt — reach, noise, handling, how long they run — and each was a STAND-IN to look at and to listen to: drawn as
// the issue carbine, the guards' short rifle or the issue pistols, speaking with their reports. With the switch on a row that names things of its `own`
// (weapons.ts WeaponDef.own) is drawn as its own model (the part tables below, laid out in the group its `rig` names — so the trigger hand, the sling and the
// holster are where they were), has its support hand where that model takes one, its muzzle where that model's is, speaks with its own voice (audio/sfx.ts),
// shows its own flame (effects.ts muzzleFx) and is fed the way it is fed (gunreload.ts: a belt under a feed cover, shells one at a time, a long magazine).
// The pump gun of the big slot (m870) is drawn as a pump gun too: it was the guards' short rifle in his hands and on his back.
// Off (the module, the frozen stand, `?nogunlook`): every row as its stand-in fields say — the build before. `GUNLOOK_BREAK=1` (tools/qa/gunlook-check.ts):
// a row's `own` is not read, so two picks share a model and a voice again and the check fails.
// PICTURE AND SOUND, with three things the simulation reads, all three only of a man who carries one of these rows (nobody does with gunslots.ts off): where his
// muzzle is (the model's far face), how bright his muzzle's flash is (the flame's light gain), and the beats inside his reload (never its length: the row's).
