// AN OPEN FIRE — the oil drum of burning wood a level stands in a yard (the pass's and the yard's braziers). The maintainer, 10-23: 'we gotta improve our fire! we have
// barrels with fire on them … great fire with smoke and crackles and dynamic lighting would look sick.' Until now such a drum was a glowing lid and a steady lamp.
//   WHICH     a level's light whose name starts with one of FIRE.names ('brazier'), with the glowing box the level hung on it (its mouth: where, and how wide).
//             TODO(LevelData): a `fire` key on the light; today the name says it, as a street lamp's height says it to the moths.
//   THE LIGHT the level's own lamp, as authored, FLICKERED: its strength about the authored one (the noise's mean is the authored number; the cracks' kick puts about a twentieth on it), its place wandering a hand's
//             width, a kick when the wood cracks. An engine light like any other, so the picture, the bounce, the men lit by it and the LIGHT METER all have the
//             same thing: near a fire a man's reading now moves with the flames (docs/agents/render.md has what was measured).
//   THE COALS the glowing box the level hung on the lamp, dimmed to a share of its authored glow under the flame and breathing with the light (FIRE.coals).
//             Its glow reaches the bounce like any glowing box's, so what the GPU's meter reads of the lid is that much less; the CPU's estimate never read it.
//   THE FLAME a small volume of light the composite draws over the drum's mouth, with the smoke off its tips and the shimmer of the air over it — closed forms of
//             the game's clock (render/shaders/fire.wgsl; this file hands the renderer a record a fire, the four nearest the view, and FIRE.look's numbers).
//             Picture only: a replay, a restart or a rollback draws the same flame.
//   THE EMBERS GPU particles (render/particles.ts, sparks filed as embers), for a fire near the view, when the page has particles (none without: `?noparticles`).
//             The host's: what a fire still owes is kept in the host's book, and the pool is the picture's, so a replay's embers are like, not the same. They are
//             drawn after the composite: the flame does not hide one behind it, and the shimmer does not move them.
//   THE SMOKE real gas in the smoke solver: a hot source as wide as the drum, filed over the flames, on the lattice the cans' smoke lives on, so it climbs, leans in
//             the wind, pools under a roof and is lit by its own fire. A LOOK source (smoke/types.ts `look`): the game's own smoke, the one sight lines are cut
//             by on the headless stand, never hears of it; in the page the men's sight lines are read off the solver, so the source's FOOT is over a standing
//             man's head and the gas only climbs from there: a line at 1.9 m or under keeps its light (a line starts to count smoke under 0.8 of it; measured
//             in the page, docs/agents/render.md). Two things learnt setting it: a source two cells wide does not climb in the solver whatever its heat (it
//             hung where it was filed, a haze at head height that cut a line along the wind to a quarter), one five cells wide does. Only for a fire near the
//             view (FIRE.smoke.viewR), only while the solver draws, and not on the graphics preset that sheds it (the floor rung: settings.fireSmoke, written by
//             ui/quality.ts FIRE SMOKE SHED): while one is, the solver is awake (the same file has what that costs).
//   THE SOUND a low bed that follows the fire's heat, and a crack with each pop of the wood — the same pop that throws embers and kicks the light. The mixer's
//             alone: no event is filed, nobody in the game hears a fire.
//   WHEN OUT  the lamp's own target says (shot out, the pistol's jammer, a level that starts it cold): no light, so no flame, smoke or sound either.
// NOBODY reads any of it but the light meter — and of the meter, only who asks how lit a MAN is now. A rule that asks for a place's STEADY light (guards.ts
// lightEstimateAt, `steadyOnly`: is this room lit enough to work in, is that floor dark) is told the lamp without its flicker (RtLight.steady: the level's strength × FIRE.bright, where the level hung it, the level's size). Its clock is the game's (`g.time`): every number here is a closed form of it, nothing is kept between frames but the
// counts the probes read — a replay, a restart or a rollback draws the same fire. What hangs on the HOST (is a solver drawing, the graphics preset, where
// the view looks, the bed's voice in the mixer) is kept on the host (`engine.hostBooks.fire`): no snapshot or state hash carries it. Its dice are its own hash (never Math.random, never the game's die).
// THE SWITCH: FIRE.on — ON in the page (`?fire=0` puts it off), OFF in the module and on the frozen stand (FROZEN_HOLDS; TPS_FIRE=1 raises it there). Off = the
// glowing lid and the steady lamp, the build as it was. tools/qa/fire-check.ts (FIRE_BREAK=1 fails it). The look was set on the software adapter's stills
// (tools/qa/fire-lab.cjs, fire-page.cjs). SEEN ON A GPU ONCE, the first cut, in one still: docs/agents/render.md says what it showed and what was changed for it;
// the second in two ("still very ugly"); the third he played, and set the look's numbers himself in the fire lab (FIRE.look, below).
