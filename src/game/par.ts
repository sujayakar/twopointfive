// A PAR: a room clear run AGAINST A CLOCK (the Door Kickers star rating). A level file carries a `scenarios.par` block (scene/scenarios.ts ParData:
// gold / silver / bronze seconds and `lossSecs`); while that level's room clear is up, this module times the run and, once, names the medal.
//
//   THE CLOCK STARTS on the first thing anybody DOES: the squad's first order (a row on orders.log), Sam's first stride off the mark the staging stood him on
//   (PAR_START_M), or his first round or throw — whichever comes first: reading the house from the start line is free, doing anything is not.
//   IT STOPS when the room clear ends 'taken' (roomclear.ts `end`, at its own `endAt`). A run that ends 'wiped' has no time.
//   EVERY TEAMMATE LOST (down at the end: dead, out cold or wounded — the floor keeps all three as state 'dead') adds `lossSecs`: the total is what the medals
//   are held against, so a run that loses men ranks under a clean one of the same pace.
//   THE MEDAL IS JUDGED ON WHAT IS SHOWN: the total in whole seconds, as the clock words it (65.4 s reads 1:05 and is inside a 1:05 gold).
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT: a rule. Like the lesson (lesson.ts) it only READS the game — it moves nobody, ends nothing and writes nothing the simulation reads (one HUD
// line through Game.msg at the end, which no AI and no digest reads) — so a level with the block plays the same run with `PAR.on` false (`?nopar`), and a level
// without the block returns on the first line of every entry point. Seams: game.ts (`par.tick()` right after updateMission), mission.ts objectiveText (the room
// clear's row carries the clock), savestate.ts (the clock's slice — though the game refuses a checkpoint while a squad is on the floor, so today it is unreached).
// No dice, no camera, nothing off the GPU. A BEST TIME is the page's to keep (main.ts + ui/parBest.ts): it hands its words back through `best()`, which only
// words the line already said.
//
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
