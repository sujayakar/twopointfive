// NIGHT VISION FOR THE TEAM (the maintainer, 10-06: "the squad members should have night vision and use it accordingly. this could either be following your
// lead or knowing when they haven't been compromised and flashlight would ruin that." — "but the lights make sense too, especially when things are loud" —
// "ready or not is a good base case here"). Every teammate (an operative unit, while the room fight is live — a scenario, never a showcase's cast) wears the
// goggles Sam wears, and each frame two things are decided for him here, nowhere else:
//
//   IS HE DARK — his weapon light held off whatever guards.ts LIGHTS would burn it for. Asked only of the men that rule has (lightRuled: under one of Sam's orders, LIGHTS on).
//     THE LEAD (NVG.lead; the Ready or Not base case: the squad does what its leader does): Sam's own light switched on, the gun it is on in his hands, frees
//       theirs — the light rule has them, as it had before this file; Sam on HIS goggles with his light off puts them dark, quiet or loud, for as long as he stays so.
//     THEIR OWN JUDGEMENT (NVG.own; Sam doing neither): dark while the team has NOT BEEN COMPROMISED — nothing loud has reached a teammate's ears (roomfight's
//       own record, Op.hotT: gunfire at the hearing model's level 1, a charge, a boot), no alarm is up (and, NVG.huntFrees, no man the team can see is hunting) — for
//       NVG.quietSecs after the last of those. Loud: the light rule has them again ("the lights make sense too, especially when things are loud"). One thing
//       overrides it: a place TOO DARK FOR THE TUBE (below; NVG.blackAt) — where the floor along his gun, the mark he is walking to, a footfall he has
//       heard or the point he is turning to look at has no light of the place on it at all (two readings running: one black sample in passing lights
//       nothing), the light rule has him as it had: his eyes are his goggles where the tube shows him the way and his light where it does not.
//   ARE HIS GOGGLES DOWN — whenever his own light is not burning and the place he is working in is dark to the bare eye (the floor under him, along his gun or
//     on the mark he is nearly at, or his target, reads under NVG.darkAt on the meter's scale, the place's own lights only — LIGHTS.litAt's question). Up in a lit place, up
//     behind his own white light. A man nobody orders about (a drill's, the rescue's flow, the fight AI's) still flips his own goggles; only his light is not ours.
//
// WHAT THE GOGGLES DO is the picture's own tube (render/shaders/post.wgsl, the N key): sig = ln(1 + lum · gain) / ln(1 + gain) with lum the radiance a man's
// clothes send the lens under the scene's exposure and gain the same engine.settings.nvGain the post pass reads — move the panel's tube gain and what the
// team sees through theirs moves with the picture. tubeVis() turns that screen brightness back into the light meter's 0‥1 (the irradiance that would put the
// same brightness on a bare-eyed picture, through Game.visibilityOf) and takes off the tube's scintillation where the signal is weakest (the shader's noise
// term). guards.ts sightGainOn reads it for a goggled eye beside the light ON the man: nothing else about how a teammate sees changes — cone, range, line of
// sight, smoke, motion, the reaction beats are all as they were. Darkness the meter calls 0 % (E ≈ 0.03) reads ≈ 0.6 through the tube; no light at all
// reads nothing (a tube amplifies, it does not invent — which is what the illuminator on the goggles is for: irlight.ts). Enemies have no night vision: a dark teammate in a dark
// place is to them what a dark Sam is.
//
// NVG.on false = no goggles on anybody, no dark, no tube: every function below answers as if this file did not exist (the build before it, to the frame).
// State is per Game and derived every frame (nothing saved: a load re-derives it inside a frame).
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
