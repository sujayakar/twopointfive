// SILENT OR LOUD — the squad's posture, on Sam's word.
//
// The play note: "some way of telling the squad to be silent or not. silent implies walking quietly, no flashlight, etc." One order on the squad's menu
// (orders.ts: X, then 5 — on the floor's menu and on a man's; never on a door's, where 5 is the door tools) puts the WHOLE squad in silent, whoever the menu
// was addressed to, and the row that stands in its place while they are silent takes them out again. It stays until he says otherwise. LOUD is the team
// exactly as it was: every rule here returns on its first line with the squad loud, so with the order never given nothing in the game changes.
//
// What a silent teammate does differently — each line has its switch, off = as loud:
//   pace     his legs are asked for no more than SILENT.pace (a walk, a touch over Sam's own upright 1.55 so a man told to fall in keeps up with him)
//            — guards.ts teamPace, so the order runner, the door tools and the fight AI's chase all take it. It holds with rounds going off too:
//            nothing ends the order but his word (`hotPace` on = the cap lifts for a man loud has reached since the order).
//   step     a walking footfall is filed (and mixed) at SILENT.step in place of the walk's 0.33: heard at about 3.6 m where the walk carries 5.7 — and
//            Hard's defenders, who listen for the team's boots (pressure.ts teamBoots), hear his at that level. His own skill, not Sam's — Sam's
//            crouched step is 0.125. "only the player is truly amazing" at it.
//   lights   weapon lights and torches stay off (guards.ts attachFlashlight); the goggles and the IR are nvg.ts's and irlaser.ts's, as they were — a man whose
//            light is off in a dim place brings his goggles down by that module's own rule.
//   hush     what he would have called out goes over the net instead (guards.ts say: the radio bubble, the log's '(radio)') — a radio line in every
//            sense: like any man's, it is not stepped on by his own next bark for the few seconds the barks leave a radio line alone.
//   doors    a leaf is eased, not shouldered: his contact is a quiet one (doors.ts DoorContact.quiet: the creak at 0.12 for 0.3) and the door tools' shove
//            is a creak, not the bash. (The leaf swings as fast as ever: a slow one shuts on the men behind it, and the shove files no noise either way.)
//   kicks    no boot by himself: an entry that finds its door locked picks it (`picks`), or says so and holds on it. A door NO pick opens — wedged from
//            inside (digin.ts: on a squads level the defenders wedge theirs on Standard too), a keypad's — is booted once the squad is COMPROMISED
//            (`bootWedged` — compromised at any point since the order, not only while the HUD's word lasts): the quiet is gone already and nothing quiet opens it. The posture stands (lights, pace, cans, the fire hold).
//            Not compromised, the lead says what it is and what would open it ('… say loud and we boot it.') and the order ends on the door.
//   cans     no stun canister by himself: the threshold's first can and its blind-pocket cans stay in the kit, on the word too (the pair's word reads
//            'go · step in · no bang' while they are silent).
//   fire     held on a man who has not noticed the team (not alert, not searching, awareness under `noticed`): the gun comes onto him and stays there,
//            and no round goes — the FN2000's report is modelled loud, suppressor or not (weapons.ts; `quietGun` is the one place that asks, for a
//            loadout whose kit says otherwise: a quiet gun is not held). A man who has noticed is shot as ever, and a
//            silent man loud has reached since the order (gunfire, a bang, a kick in his ears: roomfight.ts's hot clock) shoots whoever a loud one would.
//   glass    … and THROUGH STANDING GLASS the bar is higher (the maintainer, 10-08, on a teammate shooting a man through the conference partition: "it should
//            depend if they're loud or not. accept if loud, hold fire if they're trying to stay quiet"): a round that would have to break a pane on its way is
//            held until the man behind it has RAISED THE ALARM (alert, or searching after one) — not merely looking their way (the `noticed` bar lets go at a
//            suspicious man half sure of a shape; through a window that shot wakes the floor for a man who may yet look away). A quiet gun is held too: the
//            pane going is heard at thirty metres whatever the report. Loud in his ears since the order, or a captor at his last warning: no hold, as above.
//            While he holds for the glass the man is not his to stay on: anybody else he may shoot takes his muzzle, and a man who
//            has raised the alarm before any man he is only holding on (roomfight.ts GLASS_LOOK: the scoring in tickOp).
// SILENT NEVER COSTS THE HOSTAGE: with a captor at his last warning (rescue.ts lastWarning: 'about to', his gun on one of them, one shot) no round and no
// boot is held, and the door tools' own last-warning can goes in.
// THE LOUD TOOLS stay on the menu, marked LOUD while the squad is silent (LOUD_ROWS: bang and clear, the charge, bang then step in): picking one does it
// and takes the squad out of silent with one line — a can or a charge is his word for loud. So does a bang and clear started any other way (a
// scenario's F: DoorTools.order).
// COMPROMISED: the first time loud reaches a silent man after the order, one of them says so over the net and the HUD's word says it while it lasts.
// Who a man may shoot widens; the pace, the lights, the cans and the boots stay as ordered until Sam says loud. (Noise from before the order is not it.)
//
// Scope: the squad under Sam's orders (SquadOrders.active — never a showcase's cast, never the tour), every rule a return on its first line otherwise.
//
// `SILENT.start` is the posture a freshly staged squad stands up in (false = loud) — the loadout screen's row.
// State is per Game in a WeakMap (as nvg.ts keeps its own): nothing on the Game, nothing in the digest, nothing in a checkpoint (none is taken with a unit on
// the floor). Probes: tools/qa/silent-probes.ts (`probes.ts silent`) — the QA harness stands the game up with SILENT.on false (src/host/standup.ts), so every
// older menu probe sees the menu it was written against; that family turns it on.
