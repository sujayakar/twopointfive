// HIS OWN ACTIONS ARE A RING ON ONE KEY (the maintainer, 10-22: "radial menu for our own actions, remove existing menu in top left and awkward scrolling
// thing", "move whistle to our actions and remove v binding", "rework equipment selection and move our actions to E", "i think same would go for our
// actions (1-5 with the ring open)", "we can make our actions and squad actions symmetric, where maybe we have some way of showing in the UI … what the
// default action might be. or maybe that could be in the top left, which might be fine", "do we need a way to cancel all in progress stuff? tab could be
// that for us").
//
// THE RULE. The interaction key's TAP does the default action, as it always did. The key kept down a moment puts his rows up as a ring at the cursor
// (interact.ts: the ring cmdring.ts CMDRING.hands drew as a prototype, now standing without the squad's switch — with this rule on, that prototype's
// own switch and tick change nothing), and the ring is read by the press rule agreed with the squad ring's owner: let go with the cursor out on a wedge
// and that wedge is done; let go in the middle and the ring STAYS with no key held. Standing, a digit 1 to 5 does its wedge at once, a left click does the lit one (and is not his trigger), the key again does the lit
// one, a right click or the back key (Tab) puts it away with nothing done. The held list with its wheel and its cancel row is gone.
//
// THE WHISTLE IS A WEDGE (interact.ts whistleWedge): the LAST wedge, always the same one, wherever fewer rows than wedges are on offer — so on open
// floor the ring is that one wedge. It is no row of the list, so it is never what a tap does (a noise is chosen, never fallen into) and nothing that
// reads the rows meets it. Where the rows fill every wedge, and while a verb runs, there is no whistle: a step away or the verb's end gives it back. The key the whistle had is taken off it by the page's board (host/keymap.ts: its row has no key until the player gives
// it one); the game still answers its old code, so a recording and every check that presses it are as they were.
//
// THE CORNER SHOWS ONE LINE (ui/overlay.ts deriveInteractions): what a tap would do now, and nothing where a tap does nothing. A running verb's own
// row and the squad's block under it are as they were.
//
// THE KEY (host/keymap.ts KEYMAP.handWhen): while this rule is on the whistle's row has no key, and while the empty-hands slot (handslot.ts) is on as
// well the E key gives the interaction's code and the Space key gives the game nothing; the game goes on asking for the code it always asked for
// (consts.ts INTERACT_KEY).
//
// OFF in the module and on the frozen stand (`TPS_HANDRING=1` raises it); ON in the page (`?handring=0`: the list on a held Space, the corner list, the
// whistle on its key, as it was). Registered in knobs.ts; a recording from before the key replays with it off (journal.ts applyKnobs).
