// A SMOKE — a man a level's script has told to have one (director.ts OrderPatch.smoke → GuardScript.smoke; the first is the ledger's night man, who looks
// for a whistle, finds nothing and turns his back: levels/tut-quiet.script.ts). The maintainer, 10-22, of that man standing over the player's prints in the
// snow: 'maybe we should make him stop a bit further away and then turn around for a cigarette break', and 'cigarette break animation (with real smoke!)
// would be sick'.
//   WHO       a living man on his feet whose script says `smoke`, once he stands where it sent him. Not a man in an arm, not a man the script has let go
//             of (the order is the script's: a man handed back to the game has both hands for the game the frame he is).
//   THE HAND  his LEFT (the torch and the gun are the right's): up to his mouth to light it, then down at his side, and up again for a draw every `every`
//             seconds. The animator's own layer (character.ts smokeLayer, its numbers SMOKEARM) carries the arm; this file only says how far up it is asked.
//   THE LIGHT a lighter's flame at his mouth as he lights it, and the end going bright at every draw: the engine's own short lights (LightSet.flash, as a
//             muzzle's), so the picture and the light meter have the same thing. Small: a flame lights a face and a hand's reach of wall.
//   THE SMOKE real smoke: sources on the smoke solver's fine lattice, the one a gun's gas and the cold's breath live on. A thin thread off the end in his
//             hand all the while, and what he breathes out after each draw, off his mouth, thicker than a breath and slower to go. Both are LOOK sources
//             (smoke/types.ts `look`): the game's own smoke, the one sight lines are cut by, never hears of them. With no solver drawing (the harness, a
//             page with smoke off) what he breathes out is the particle system's soft puffs, as a breath in the cold is; the thread is then not shown.
//   NOBODY    reads any of it but the light meter: no eye, ear or foot. Its clock is the frames' dt, its dice are its own (never Math.random, never the
//             game's die).
// THE SWITCH: SMOKEBREAK.on — ON in the page (`?smokebreak=0` puts it off), OFF in the module and on the frozen stand (FROZEN_HOLDS; TPS_SMOKEBREAK=1
// raises it there). Off, a man told to smoke stands where he was sent with his hands as they were. tools/qa/smokebreak-check.ts (SMOKEBREAK_BREAK=1 fails it).
// The numbers are set from the solver's arithmetic and the breath's own; NEVER SEEN ON A GPU.
