// WIND — the building's air as ONE field (the maintainer: "for hvac vents, that should model wind which then also influences the smoke solver"). Three kinds
// of source, every one ANALYTIC and cheap, summed: the level's HVAC supply VENTS (levels/*.json vents[] → Level.vents: a cone jet out of each diffuser's face,
// speed × 1/(1 + (d/reach)²) down its axis × a Gaussian across, cut off at 2.5 × reach, a jet blown at a floor turning to run along it — the field's one text is
// render/shaders/wind_field.wgsl; jetVel / stormVel below repeat it on the CPU), the STORM outdoors (weather.ts's wind vector, read — never its dice — gusting on
// a noise of the clock, nothing inside the two roofed footprints — or, weatherKinds.ts WX_OWN.wind, under any of a level's three or four roofs — easing in off the facade), and a GUST through every OPEN EXTERIOR DOOR (a short jet along the
// inward normal ∝ how far the leaf stands open × how hard the storm blows at that face). Every source folds its own state into ONE speed a frame — a vent's slow
// cycling and its spin-down when the mains go (the air handler is on the breaker), the gusting — and that record goes, unchanged, to BOTH GPU consumers:
//   • the particles (render/particles.ts setWind → the update kernel's windAir): dust and paper take their drag against the MOVING air, chips a share
//     of it, brass none; a leaf lying under a diffuser trembles and now and then one is picked up and slides (the impulse lane's 'co-moving gust' generalised);
//   • the smoke solver (smoke.ts setWind → the forces kernel's windForce): the simulated air of every live brick a source overlaps is relaxed toward the field
//     inside its support, and the pressure solve does the rest — a plume under a vent bends, one by an open door in the storm leans in, dust off the ceiling
//     drifts down the jet. The guards' smoke sight lines march THAT density (game.ts probe.querySegment): the picture and the AI stay one model with nothing added.
// Wind never allocates: no brick of smoke is made, kept or given back for it (the solver only ever masks the bricks it already has), no particle is born of it, the record
// pools are fixed. BOUNDED: ≤ WIND_GPU_MAX (8) records to either consumer a frame (the particles take the nearest to the view and share
// the impulses' sixteen slots BEHIND them — a bang is never short of a slot; the solver keeps those over its smoke, past eight the nearest the view, and masks them per brick), O(vents + exterior doors) CPU a frame. DETERMINISTIC:
// every wobble is a hash of the game clock and the source's own seed — never Math.random, never anybody's dice (the storm's stroke schedule must not shift).
// `tune.wind` (0‥1, default 1) scales every speed and 0 is the game byte for byte as it was: update() clears both consumers and returns before touching anything
// (tools/qa wind-identity). Knobs WIND below (Tab ▸ Weather ▸ wind rows, kept per machine with the master: localStorage twopointsix.wind).
