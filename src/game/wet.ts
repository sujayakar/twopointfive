// Wet characters (the weather's other half — game/weather.ts rains, this soaks whoever stands in it). ONE model, presentation and state alike: every Character
// (Sam, the shift, the QRF, the breach cast, a body lying in the lot) carries `wet` (the coat: 0 dry ‥ 1 soaked) and `beads` (the layer of drops standing on
// him and running down him), driven here once a frame from where he is:
//   OUTDOORS  = outside the interior footprint AND outside the roofed stair tower (weather.ts INTERIOR / ANNEX — the very rectangles the rain shader draws by)
//               AND nothing solid between his head and the sky (an upward CPU ray through the level's own collision boxes: a man under a canopy, a lintel or a
//               roof slab stays dry — cached a quarter of a second per man, so it costs nothing);
//   IN RAIN   = outdoors while the frame actually draws rain (engine.weather.rain > 0: the storm on, not held by the breach's day, rate above zero) —
//               the coat rises at WET.soakPerSec × (0.4 + 0.6 × rate) (soaked in ~6 s in a downpour), the beads come up three times as fast toward a level the
//               rate sets; otherwise the coat dries at WET.dryPerSec (~25 s) and the beads run off in WET.beadRunoffSecs (~3 s).
// The renderer reads the two numbers per character (game.ts → CharacterRenderer.setInstance → gbuffer.wgsl fsSkin: darker, saturated fabric, a glossy clear
// coat lit in composite.wgsl, procedural drops beading and sliding down the body in its own bind-pose space) — and nothing when settings.wetChars is off or
// nobody is wet: the character shading is then bit for bit what it was.
// Two small marks of it in the world, both Sam's and both for the PLAYER's eyes only (nobody reacts to them — a follow-up for the guards' side of the one
// model: a searcher noticing wet prints): a soaked man come indoors DRIPS for a few seconds (GPU water-drop particles off his hands and hem, particleFx's
// 'debris' kind — nothing with the particles off) and leaves WET FOOTPRINTS, a 'wetprint' decal per step for his next WET.prints steps, fainter each step,
// each fading out over WET.printFadeSecs (decals.wgsl wetPrintMark; nothing with the decals off).
