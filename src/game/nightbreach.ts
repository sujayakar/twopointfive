// The NIGHT BREACH (?nightbreach, native --nightbreach, __nightbreach): a playtest scenario, not a showcase — Sam under the player's hands leads two AI operatives
// against three men barricaded in the break room, at night, with real rounds both ways. The question it exists to answer is whether going loud with a team is
// worth building a game round (SWAT 4 / Door Kickers in feel); it is staged on the old office with what the demo already has and nothing here is polished.
//
// WHAT IT IS MADE OF. The team's half is the daytime showcase's own drill (breach.ts BreachDrill, in its `live` mode): the pair wait on the plan's approach marks,
// run in and stack on Sam's FIRST order, and boot the leaf, put the stun charge in and flow to their corners on his SECOND — F both times. The defenders' half is the
// fight AI (guards.ts): three hostile units on the plan's marks, held and pinned there (they fire from where they stand and never come out), their guns on the door
// while they are calm, left entirely to their own eyes and ears — they hear the boot, are dazzled by the charge like anybody with eyes on it, and shoot back. The
// operatives fire the drill's controlled pairs, but only at a man they have a line to; everybody's rounds are fireWeapon's, and anybody they find goes down. A
// teammate down ends nothing while the other is up. Sam is his own man throughout: follow them in, take the north door, or stand in the aisle and watch.
//
// BLIND FIRE — what makes the default a fight (the `blindFire` knob, on). The demo's stun charge is the stealth game's: a man with eyes on it can neither see nor
// shoot for 2.9 to 5.1 s in this room, and the drill needs 2.5 s, so behind it the breach was a walkover the defenders never fired in; without it the team lost the
// doorway most of the time. With the knob on a dazzled defender does what a man covering a door does when a charge goes off in his face: he keeps his gun on the
// door and empties a burst down it without seeing anything (BLIND below: twelve rounds at the carbine's own cadence, each a real round along his barrel inside a wide
// cone). The pair goes in on the bang, through that, so whether the point man is hit in the funnel is the rounds' own scatter, and a survivor finishes the room
// alone, or does not. The burst is a reflex with its moment: a round whose turn comes while he has his head down under somebody's fire (suppression.ts: pinned),
// is doubled over a ring, is in Sam's arm or has his gun down is never fired — so Sam's covering burst past the man facing the door, as it goes in, costs that man
// his rounds (headless: his and no other's; the two off the door's line still fire). A blind round's report tells his colleagues where the rounds are going,
// not where anybody is (FireOpts.blind). Knob off = the charge as the night game has it (the walkover); `stun` off = boot and go.
//
// THE STAGING, AND GETTING OUT OF IT. start() benches the shift the way the Director benches it for the day showcase (off Game.guards, torches out of the light set:
// the staff are neutral to both sides — teams.ts — and the character budget is eight with bodies) and restarts the encounter; restartEncounter's last act while the
// scenario is up is onEncounterRestart() here, which stages the cast on the fresh floor. So ANY restart under it — Sam down and Enter, the pause card, restage() —
// stages it again with no caller knowing about it, and a bare resetGuards (the panel's, a console's: the cast are units, it despawns them) is noticed by tick() and
// answered with a full restart. While it is up the civilians are not spawned and the response team and the cameras / tripwires are silent (one-line gates on
// `nightBreach.active` in civilians.ts / qrf.ts / devices.ts — no Game.tune switch is written, so nothing a panel row saves can carry the scenario's state onto the
// machine). stop() puts the shift back and restarts the encounter as the night game has it. Checkpoints, the session journal and both showcases refuse while it is
// up (they refuse on any unit standing; savestate.ts canLoad asks this module too).
//
// KNOWN, BY DECISION: the operatives' controlled pairs are the drill's — gated on a line to the man (statics and leaves), not on light or smoke as the defenders'
// eyes are; and once inside they hold their corners (nobody follows Sam on to the next room).
//
// With the flag off none of this runs: Game.update's one call into tick() returns on its first line, and BreachDrill without `live` is the show's drill as it was.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load — the knobs are a plain literal.)
