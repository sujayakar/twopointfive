// A BLAST TAKES A DOOR OFF ITS HINGES (Game.doors.blast, __doorblast; the maintainer: 'doors … can be blown off hinges').
//
// THE SEAM. Whatever sets a blast off calls ONE thing about doors: `g.doors.blast(at, tearM, who)` (doors.ts — it lands in doorBlast below). `tearM` is the
// blast's own number: the distance inside which it takes an ordinary interior leaf out of its frame (DOORBLAST.tearM is the table the callers read: a stun
// canister 0 = never, a frag 1.5 m). A charge SET ON a leaf is contact: doortools.ts blow() calls tearOff itself. A boot, a shoulder, a breaching
// shotgun at the lock never come here: they leave the leaf hung (doors.ts kickIn; rounds enough take a wooden one apart their own way: DOORSHOT below) — but for ONE boot, the player's at a full run at the face a shut leaf opens
// toward (sprintdoor.ts; player.ts updateKick calls tearOff): the leaf can only go where that boot sends it by leaving its frame. Steel doors do not come off.
//
// WHAT COMING OFF IS. Door.off: the leaf's own box becomes a loose SLAB — it leaves the frame away from the blast, its foot dragging, topples top-first (or, with
// no room ahead to lie in, goes flat to the far wall and falls back through its own doorway), slams flat and lies there: an ordinary 5 cm box on the floor. ONE
// MODEL: that box is still the one in the collision layer's dynamic list, so sight, shots and the sound walk find nothing in the frame and a slab under their
// lines; its SoundSeal bit is gone, so the mixer, the hearing model and the smoke bake read an open doorway; and to every reader of a door's STATE it is a door
// standing wide open, unlatched, its lock gone for good (doors.ts: angle ±OFF_ANGLE) — so the AI walks it as the open doorway it is, nobody is sent to open it,
// and no verb (use / ease / pull to / kick / pick, the lockdown's tidy-up, a defender shutting himself in) moves it. Door.reset() hangs it again, so a restart, a
// scenario's own staging and a checkpoint's clean slate all put it back; a checkpoint files it lying where it came (or would come) to rest.
//
// What it does NOT do (each a call left on the notes page): the slab hurts nobody, and furniture never feels it — flying or lying (game.ts hands the props
// the hung leaves only: a chair rolls over the slab); a blast outside tearM does nothing to a leaf at all; the slab loses its kick plates when it lands
// (markings want an upright face) and the marks rounds left on it do not ride it down; a checkpoint taken while it flies files it already lying where it
// will stop, so the load never hears it land.

 *  THE COUNT is the wall engine's own: wallbreak.ts WallBreak.round hands every round that met a leaf to `leafRound` with the weight a wall's cell would
 *  have taken for it (a rifle round 1 at chaos 0.5, a pistol round WALLS.pistolK of that; of a shotgun's pellets the ones the walls are handed), and the
 *  leaf stands `leafTough()` of it — `toll` times plasterboard's own number (or wood's if that were ever less) — ONE count for the whole leaf, wherever
 *  on it and on whichever face the rounds land, and it gives whole where drywall keeps its sill. With `flat` the count is A COST and the same wherever the
 *  Tab 'chaos' slider stands above nothing (a wall's still rides it: at its top drywall opens in three while a leaf asks its twelve); without, as a wall's. A
 *  round that goes on through (wallpen.ts) counts as one that stops; so does one fired with the gun pressed through the leaf (combat.ts wallAcrossArm).
 *  Past half its toll the leaf sheds splinters with every round. Then it goes IN PIECES, by the destruction's own gradient: strips along the grain cut
 *  to uneven lengths and thrown the way the round was going as rigid debris (the pool's own cap: what it refuses goes as splinters), each TAGGED WOOD and
 *  dressed by the break table (breakTable.ts retag + dress: a snapped end, a splinter's taper, a board's torn corners — a door's paint would otherwise
 *  read as masonry or sheet metal), then slivers, then dust-fine splinters; where the cuts fall goes by where the last round struck, so no two doors break alike. What is left is
 *  the LOCK RAIL lying by the frame with the handles on it — the leaf's own box, so to every reader this is a door off its hinges (Door.off: an open
 *  doorway to sight, shots, sound, smoke, the AI and every door order; reset() hangs it; a checkpoint files the rail where it lies and a leaf's count
