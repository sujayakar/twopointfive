// KIT ANIMATIONS — Sam handles his kit with his hands (the maintainer, 10-10: "we should have better animations for equipping and unequipping kit. like rifle for
// sam goes on his back, pistol in holster, knife, etc. reloads can be more detailed too (and vary based on tactical reload vs. not)" · "the closer than ever
// animation could use some work. sam's hand looks pretty static. and it should be reaching for his knife. one thing chaos theory did well was having sam's
// state vary continuously with his distance to the enemy").
//
// This file is the GAME's half: it decides WHEN, off the game's own state, and hands the animator its inputs. The poses are character.ts (KIT: kitSwap /
// kitLayer, pistolReloadArm, the `keep` variant of reloadArm, closeK in creepLayer / readyLayer); the props are rigProps.ts (KitDraw).
//
//   EQUIP    kitTick() watches what is in Sam's right hand by the game's rules (kitInHand: the pistol, the rifle, a can, the knife of an arm hold, nothing) and
//            on a change starts a swap: the old thing is carried to where it lives (pistol → thigh holster, rifle → over the shoulder onto the sling across his
//            back, can → belt pouch, knife → the sheath on his chest), the hand goes on to the next thing and brings it up. While it runs the drawer shows what
//            the HAND has (kitShow), not what the slot says, and a gun coming up cannot fire until it is up (Player.equipT, the lock-out every fire site already
//            honours — it was 0.45 s for anything involving the rifle and nothing for the pistol; now it is the draw's own length).
//   RELOAD   kitReload() picks the magazine change off the gun's state — EMPTY (dry magazine, nothing chambered: the magazine falls, a fresh one, the slide /
//            handle run), DRY (dry magazine, a round still up: the same without the slide) or TACTICAL (rounds left in the magazine: it is taken out and PUT
//            AWAY, then the fresh one; slower) — and gives the weapon and the animator that change's own beat (KITANIM.beats, scaled to the weapon's row).
//   CLOSE    kitTick() also deals the animator how close the nearest man of the close-in mode is, 0‥1: the carriage deepens and the knife hand travels to the
//            hilt with it, continuously (KIT.close).
//
// WHILE A SWAP RUNS (anim.kitBusy): no reload starts (player.ts reloadInHand), a can not yet in the fist is not thrown by LMB, no checkpoint is written
// (savestate.ts playerBusy), and a gun's light, lit lens and IR laser wait until it is UP (kitGunUp). A gun leaving the hand abandons its magazine change.
// Needs the MOVES' reload layer for the magazine hands (anim.kitHandsOn): without it a reload is the weapon row's, as ever.
//
// SWITCH: KITANIM.on — ON in the page (`?nokitanim` = the build as it was), OFF in the harness's frozen stand (TPS_KITANIM=1 turns it on there): off, nothing in
// this file calls anything and every pose, prop, beat and lock-out is what it was. Sam only (the one Player); nothing under the tour.
// Per-player state lives on the Player (kitWas / kitCan); a fresh Player (a restart, a loaded checkpoint) starts with no swap pending — the kit simply is where
// the game says. No dice, no clocks of its own, nothing read from the renderer.
