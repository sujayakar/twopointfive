// SQUAD ORDERS (Game.orders, __orders): Sam's live orders to the operatives on his side — a SWAT 4 / Ready or Not command menu over whatever he is aiming at,
// given to the whole squad (gold), one pair of it (red / blue) or one man.
//
// THE GRAMMAR — Ready or Not's command menu, for a top-down mouse and keyboard (NO KEY IS EVER HELD: the maintainer, 10-04 — "the current approach of needing to hold
// down a key doesn't feel great"). PRESS X (or the MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON, RoN's own): the menu opens on what the CURSOR is on at that moment (its own world
// point — never the auto-aim's snap) — a DOOR (within ORDERS.doorPickM of a doorway or its leaf; or the cursor on its leaf, or on the floor seen THROUGH its
// doorway: ORDERS.doorRay), a spot on the FLOOR, or NOTHING (himself, a teammate, or nowhere a man can stand) — listing only the orders that fit that target, and STAYS UP, frozen on that target, while Sam walks, aims and turns the camera,
// until an order is PICKED or it is dismissed. A PICK: the row's digit at once (X then 2 — two presses, nothing held), or the wheel / ↑ ↓ to move the highlight
// and SPACE or the MIDDLE BUTTON AGAIN to give the highlighted row (the middle button twice = the target's own first row: move there / stack up / fall in —
// a whole order off the mouse). DISMISSED: X again, Esc or a RIGHT click (from a page of it: back to the first page), the cancel row; also by the page losing focus (Input's one-frame 'Blur' code), by Sam
// going down — and by THE TRIGGER: the left button is Sam's at all times, a left click with the menu up puts it away and fires (one-shot kills both ways: the
// reflex shot at a man coming round the corner must never be read as an order; ORDERS.clickGives turns that round for an A/B — the click gives the highlighted
// row and fires nothing). While it is up the digits are not Sam's weapon slots, the wheel not his pace, a Space press not the selector's, the right click not
// the OCP — everything else of his (WASD, the aim, the trigger, Q / E, F) is his as ever; and the frame the menu OPENS on takes nothing else from the input
// (a digit or a click sharing that frame was meant for the game without it). B = the target's first row AT ONCE, with no menu (RoN's default command). WHO TAKES THE ORDERS (`who`; the HUD always names it): T
// steps RoN's ELEMENT — GOLD (the whole squad) → RED (the red pair) → BLUE (the blue pair) → gold, for a squad dealt into pairs (Guard.unit.pair; the one-pair
// squad of ?roomclear / ?nightbreach steps all → each man, as it always did) — and T with the cursor ON A TEAMMATE addresses that ONE MAN until T is pressed
// again (on him again, or — for a squad in pairs — anywhere: back to everyone); it works with the menu up too (the list is re-read for the new men). The menu
// OPENED on a teammate is that man's alone for that one order, whatever `who` says (T on it: back to everyone; he goes down while it is up: the menu goes too). THE DIGITS ARE FIXED (OrderDef.key): 1 = the target's own order (move there / stack up), 2 = cover, 3 = fall in,
// 4 = hold, on every target — and NO ROW IS EVER ON A DIGIT ABOVE ORDER_DIGITS (5: the maintainer, 10-04 — "it's hard to hit numbers bigger than 5 when left hand is on
// wasd"). A menu with more to offer than that is in PAGES, Ready or Not's way: a row that OPENS a page (OrderDef.opens — 'door tools ▸', digit 5 on a door)
// swaps the list for that page's own rows on 1 up (OrderDef.page), the menu still up on the same target; Esc or a right click there steps BACK to the first
// page — from a page behind a page, to the page it was opened from (X closes it from anywhere). A row may STAND IN for another while something lasts
// (OrderDef.standsIn: on a door whose threshold is held, row 5 is 'threshold held ▸' — what to tell the men on its jambs — where 'door tools ▸' was). register() deals the first page's spare digit (5) and a page's digits from 1, and a row that finds none left has no digit
// (the wheel still reaches it). A row with a key of its own (OrderDef.hotKey — the word: F) shows that key and takes no digit. An order that fits the target but cannot be carried out right now (no path to the spot, a door locked
// against Sam on every way to it, no room at the jambs, no line to cover from) keeps its row, GREYED with the reason (re-asked every ORDERS.refreshSecs while
// the menu stays up, with the door's face re-read off where Sam now stands), and giving it is refused aloud by one of the men ("can't get there."); where only
// ONE man cannot do his part (OrderDef.can) he says so and is left exactly as he was while the others go. A spot whose short way in is locked but which has
// another way round is offered, and the man is walked round (route()).
//
// THE ORDERS (built in below; a later part adds the door tools through register()):
//   fall in      follow Sam: the men file down the trail he has walked (through whatever doors he took) at his own pace plus what closes the gap, close up
//                behind him when he stops — the first man looking on the way the file was going, the last the way they came — at the low ready. When Sam
//                turns back down the file a man in his way steps off his line, lets him through and falls in behind (aside()); once Sam has stopped, a man
//                already near him in plain sight stays where he is (no walking round Sam to an exact place — a lean out past a corner is not followed)
//   hold         stop where he stands, facing as he faces, low ready
//   move there   go to the spot at once, gun up the way he goes (the pair side by side across the line Sam pointed along), and cover on from it the way they were sent
//   cover        stay where he stands and put the gun on the named spot / the named door: a flank watched for as long as the order stands
//   stack up     onto the door's jambs on Sam's side of it, muzzle on the door all the way in — one man a jamb (both in file on the one free side when the other
//                is walled off), bladed to the wall, muzzles on the opening
// The men take turns saying so in a word ('moving.', 'covering.'); a move or a stack is called 'set.' by the last man on once everybody sent is on his mark.
// A man whose gun line Sam walks into (ORDERS.laneIn) lowers the muzzle until he is clear.
// AN ORDER SETS WHERE A MAN IS AND WHERE HE WATCHES — never when he shoots. The men are moved through squad.ts's script runner (Guard.script: nav path, settle
// on the mark, facing, aim point, stance), which has no senses and no trigger. THE SEAM FOR A FIGHT LAYER: a man under orders whose script somebody has ended
// with his state 'alert' (endGuardScript(gd, 'alert') — handed to the fight AI) is left to it while his fight is warm — eyes on somebody, a shot in his ear or
// the hand-over itself inside ORDERS.coldSecs, or mid-reload; or for as long as `fight.engaged(gd)` says, when a fight layer sets the lease (`fight`: engaged /
// yielded / retaken) — rooted on his post by Guard.pinned (ORDERS.pinPosted; free to move under 'fall in'), and taken back onto his order after; `of(gd)` says
// where his order wants him, what it has him watch and (faceNow) which way a follower is facing. assign() lifts whatever hold / pin another owner left on him.
//
// OTHER OWNERS OF THE MEN (`owners`): a drill that moves the squad itself says so here — while it owns a man an order to him first asks it to let go (the night
// breach, nightbreach.ts: a stack not yet sent in is called off, a pair already inside is recalled, the seconds of boot and charge are refused), and a man a drill
// has taken (F: stack up) drops his order.
//
// With no operative on the floor none of this runs: input() and tick() are one pass over the guard list and a return, X, T and the middle button are dead, the HUD gains
// nothing. NOT DONE HERE: who owns a man's script is settled case by case (`owners`, and nightbreach.ts asking has()) — a Director play program or the QRF
// ordering an operative under one of Sam's orders is not arbitrated; the stack's marks are geometry (stackPosts), not tactics.ts's authored clear-plan marks.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load — the knobs are a plain literal, the order table is
// built in the constructor.)
