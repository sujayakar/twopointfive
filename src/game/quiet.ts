// THE QUIET MISSION: the level's own night, live, with a thing to take and ways out — on ANY level whose file carries a `scenarios.quiet` block
// (scene/scenarios.ts QuietData), alone or with ONE partner. `?quiet` on the URL (scene/scenarioList.ts; ui/missions.ts lists its rows), `?quiet=N` pins the deal,
// `&squad=1` brings the partner.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT: a cast. Nobody is posted and nobody is benched for effect — the level's routes are walked by its own night staff (team 'guard', the patrol
// → suspicious → alert → search machine, their radio, their rollcall), its devices sense and its civilians work, exactly as the plain night has them. None of
// the gates keyed on the night breach / the rescue is touched, so everything the plain night runs, this runs.
//
// WHAT IT ADDS, all of it read from the level's data:
//   THE DEAL (replay — "make the game fun and replayable. think door kickers 2"): every start of the encounter deals one of the block's `starts`, one of its
//     `spots` (where the thing is) and one of its `patrols` (which routes are manned) — off the Game's own die (math/dice.ts simRandom: `?seed=` reproduces a
//     run) or, pinned (`?quiet=N`), off a stream of its own that deals the same every time. A restart deals again unless pinned.
//     The deal is WRITTEN INTO the Level for the run — `level.playerSpawn` = the start, `level.mission` = the spot and the first exit in the shape the office's
//     mission has always had — so everything that reads the mission (mission.ts, the objective row, the rack that goes dark, the marker, the debrief's pins, the
//     staff's own talk of the room) reads this one with no second code path; stop() puts the authored ones back. Routes outside the dealt patrol set are off
//     the guard list for the run, their torches out of the light set (as nightbreach.ts benches the shift — here it is the patrol set, not a cast).
//   THE WAYS OUT: every exit of the block is open on every run; out = past its point going its own way (mission.ts outThrough), so an exit faces any way.
//   THE WORDS: the place, the holder, the thing and the exits' names, in the objective lines, the row, the radio and the card (quietWords).
//   ONE PARTNER (squad 1): an operative staged at the start's `mate` mark (else the free floor a stride behind Sam), following from the first tick, under THE PAIR
//     RULES (pairup.ts: its switch and three parts on for the run) and SILENT from the first frame (silent.ts). The level's staff are HOSTILE to him and he to
//     them for the run (teams.ts staffVsOperatives) — on every other floor they never meet and stay neutral; here he is a second intruder: seen by the same eye,
//     heard by the same ears, shot at, and his takedowns land. Cameras, tripwires and civilians sense the player only (devices.ts / civilians.ts: unchanged).
//
// CHECKPOINTS: alone, the plain night's (savestate.ts) — the deal rides in the file and is dealt back on a load. With the partner on the floor a save is refused
// like on every squad run ('a spawned unit is on the floor').
//
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
