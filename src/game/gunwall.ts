/** A RAISED WEAPON COMES DOWN AT A WALL. A shouldered rifle's muzzle stands 0.63 m ahead of the man who holds it and an aimed pistol's 0.64; a man can stand
 *  with his centre 0.3 m off a wall — so every man who turned to cover a line with a wall, a jamb or a door leaf inside that reach was DRAWN with his gun in it
 *  or out through its far face (39 play-throughs of the one build: 3.1 % of all armed man-frames; nine in ten of them the shouldered carriage). Rounds have a
 *  rule for the pressed muzzle (combat.ts armThrough: the round dies in the panel) and so has the weapon light (lighting.ts LIGHTWALL); this is the GUN's:
 *
 *  1. THE LOW READY. A gun that is up (the aim; the high port of a stack or the high ready) and whose own line meets a static or a leaf inside its reach is
 *     brought to the low ready — through Guard.muzzleDown, the bit a colleague in the line already sets (guards.ts muzzleCheck): the pose, every fire gate and
 *     the visible laser read it, so nothing new has to learn about a lowered gun. Two lines are asked (walledNow): the gun AS DRAWN once it is up and settled
 *     (exact at a jamb's edge), and otherwise the carriage he WANTS, worked out from his feet and his aim (a gun already down would report nothing in the way
 *     if it were asked as drawn, and come straight back up) — with a lead for the speed he closes at and a band between down and up, so it comes down before
 *     the wall and does not flutter at the edge of the reach. A man whose point of aim IS that surface (within `atM` of where the line meets it: the shotgun
 *     on a lock — doortools.ts gunStep) keeps it up while the muzzle itself is short of it: that muzzle is there on purpose. One that would stand IN the
 *     surface comes down like any other (a man walking at the door he watches).
 *     A MAN IN A FIGHT (`hot`: the alert branch, a script's `over`) is treated more narrowly: his gun comes down only once it has stood IN a panel a round
 *     would have died in anyway (armThrough's own test), and he then moves for a line (guards.ts `poked`; roomfight.ts walks on / steps aside).
 *  2. THE TUCK. The low ready itself reaches 0.43‥0.51 m — still past a wall he is pressed to. CharacterAnimator.gunWall (0‥2, from how much room the low
 *     carriage's line has) pulls the low carriages in toward character.ts WALL_TUCK: at 1 the muzzle is inside his own collision circle, and from 1 to 2 the
 *     hand is drawn further back still (WALL_TUCK.over) for a torso twisted toward the wall.
 *
 *  Sam: the same test, the same low ready (player.ts), and no round while it is down — but for the BREACHING SHOTGUN LAID ON A LOCK (`breachAim`: the raised
 *  gun's own line meets a locked, latched leaf where a shell takes its keep): that gun stays up however close he stands, pressed to the leaf included, and the
 *  shell goes — as a teammate's on the same lock always did. A breach shot at a lock always fires. Pinned men are left alone (they cannot step for a line), and so is
 *  everybody while a showcase has the floor (its choreography was written against guns that stay up).
 *  Off (the table's own value, so a host that never says otherwise is unchanged): nothing asked, muzzleDown and gunWall never touched — the game as it was.
 *  The page turns it on (src/host/profile.ts pageSwitches; ?nogunwall = off) and so does the harness's shipped stand; its frozen stand holds it off
 *  (src/host/standup.ts; TPS_GUNWALL=1 turns it on there).
 *  `downM` / `upM`: the room past the wanted muzzle under which the gun comes down / over which it may come back up, metres. `leadS`: seconds of his closing
 *  speed added to both (the carriage takes about that long to change). `tuckM`: the room the tucked muzzle keeps; `tuckLeadS`: its lead.
 *  `fightS`: a fight anywhere on the floor (a man gone alert, a scripted man with one in his sights) makes EVERY man a man in a fight for this long after it
 *  was last seen — the calm man's margins bring a gun down a stride early, and a stride early at a jamb with defenders two rooms off is a shot not taken
 *  (0 = only the man who has a target himself).
 *  `mark`: the player's aim ring wears a bar while his gun cannot get a round out (player.ts gunShut; the overlay's, nothing in the game reads it — the
 *  words a dead click files are in no list the page draws). Off here; the page turns it on (?nogunmark = off). */

 *  where the wall is; the muzzle is asked to stand `tuckM` short of it. The carriage rides the shoulders, so its reach is taken from where the gun shoulder
 *  stood ahead of his feet in last frame's pose: a torso twisted hard round or leaning into a stride reaches further than the carriage at rest, and is
 *  pulled in by that much more. Nothing while a gun is up or no gun is in a hand; 0 with the rule off. */
