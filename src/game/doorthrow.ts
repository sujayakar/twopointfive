// A DOOR OPENED INTO A MAN STARTLES HIM; A DOOR KICKED INTO HIM THROWS HIM — what the leaf does to the man (the maintainer: 'opening a door into the enemy
// should majorly confuse them' · 'it's not like we're slamming these doors' · 'confusion here being put on alert but being very confused and investigating
// what's going on' · 'kicking down a door when an enemy on the side should stun or knock them out'; of an enemy's own boot: it stuns, it does not kill).
//
// The DOOR's side is doors.ts DOORTHROW (which leaf is a driven one and how, the carry ahead of it, the switch and its numbers): Doors.update hands back, on
// the contact of whoever a driven leaf met, DoorContact.struck — whose leaf, merely opened / shouldered at a run / booted, did he stand right at a booted
// one — and DoorContact.moved for anybody a leaf carried. This file is the game's side of both:
//   doorMan            what the doors ask about a man at a leaf (Doors.man): whose he is, whether he is folded right now (a leaf carries a folded man, it
//                      does not throw him twice), braced (just up from a fold, or in somebody's arm: no throw), held (in an arm: nothing moves him), calm (staff not alert or searching, any
//                      civilian: a leaf he opens short of a boot moves nobody)
//   doorThrowAfter     game.ts updateDoors, after the leaves are stepped: a carried man is settled against the walls, and a struck man gets —
//     a leaf OPENED into him (walked, handed, pushed, shoved, flung: tier 'open')
//       a defender             STARTLED: if he was at his round he jolts toward the door (startle.ts startleMan, the start every startled man gets), stops
//                              for DOORTHROW.startle s with his gun down and then goes to see what is at the door (suspicious, the
//                              doorway his place to look, awareness DOORTHROW.wary — the decoy's own numbers); whatever he was at is over. He keeps his
//                              feet, his gun and his eyes: what he finds at the door is his to see. A man already suspicious has the doorway for his
//                              place; one searching or fighting is moved aside and no more.
//       a civilian             alarmed as by a noise at the door (civilians.ts toAlarmed)
//       Sam, a teammate        moved aside: they know whose door it is
//     a leaf SLAMMED or BOOTED into him (tier 'slam' · 'boot') — what a stun charge at arm's length gives a man, by the SAME two stamps and nothing new:
//       a guard / a teammate   FOLDED (Guard.staggerUntil: rooted, gun down, no round) and BLIND (Guard.dazzledUntil: sees nobody) for DOORTHROW.pushSecs
//                              (a shoulder at a run), or .kickSecs under a boot; whatever he was at is over (a script, a burst, his path); a foe's leaf
//                              leaves him alert toward the doorway, with his man to find again (his own side's — only a boot of theirs throws him — just
//                              folds him). One who stood right at a booted door is on a knee for it (Guard.doorDownUntil).
//       Sam                    folded for the same seconds (samstun.ts staggerPlayer — rooted, gun low, no round or throw, what he was doing dropped);
//                              right at a booted door he is put in a crouch. With the player's fold switched off (SAMSTUN) only the clock is written,
//                              which keeps a leaf from striking him every frame, and nothing else of his changes.
//                              His eyes are the player's own: no white. God mode changes none of it (a stun is not a hit).
//       a civilian             the blow, and alarmed by it as by a noise at the door; the stamp only keeps a leaf from throwing her every frame.
// By behaviour, never by hit points: nothing here hurts or kills anybody, and no rule of the mission is read or written (a stunned Sam fails nothing here).
