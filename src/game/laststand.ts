// THE LAST DEFENDERS (the maintainer, 10-08, playing the compound: "it also took a while to find the last two stragglers. ready or not has this problem too for
// the "bring order to chaos" objective. curious how we can make this more fun while still having the peril of barricaded defenders"). Two switches, both
// `regroup` ships OFF, `callOut` ON (10-08: telling only, so the run is the run with both off) — with both off nothing here runs, no die is drawn and the room fight is run for run what it was (the seams: `lastStandTick` at the tail of
// RoomFight.tick, `lastStandStop` in stop(), one clause each in rally(), lost(), the dig-in's gate / wedge rule / stand-down, the squads' home(), the press's
// consider(), and the room clear's objective()).
//
//   WHEN. A room clear (not the hostage rescue), once `few` (3) or fewer of its defenders are up and no more than a third of the staging (the compound's
//     eleven: three; the block's eight: two; the office's five: the last man). Until that frame a run with
//     either switch on IS the run with both off: nothing is drawn or written before it, so a tally pairs by seed up to the endgame.
//   THE RADIO CHECK (both switches). The survivors do not know they are the last by telepathy: one of them who is fit and has had nobody of the team in his
//     sight these `quiet` seconds asks the net who is still up. Whoever is fit and calm answers on his own beat; a man in a fight does not answer and is not
//     counted. What the check closes with — who answered — is ALL the survivors know of each other. It is asked again every `every` seconds (`again` once they
//     have made their stand): a man who was busy the first time answers the next.
//   `callOut` — CALL OUT (telling only: nothing a man's AI, the dice of the simulation or a digest reads is written). Every answer says where the man is by
//     the level's own rooms ('still up — in the kitchen'), and the one who asked says where he is. A man nobody answers knows he is the last, and says that
//     and his room ('…if anyone can hear me, I'm in the office!'). Their net is on the HUD's radio strip (cues.ts), so the player hears where to go — said by
//     men to each other, never to the team. (`regroup` says the same places: the one who picks the room has to know where they are. `callOut` is that
//     telling half alone.)
//   `places` — THE LINE IS TRUE OF WHERE HE STANDS (on; off = the lines as they were, word for word — `callOut` stays telling only either way). A man in floor
//     nobody holds — the compound's front hall, a corridor, a yard — is 'in the front hall' by the level's own name for it (dialogue.ts placeIn: the structure's
//     rooms, then `scenarios.places`), not 'outside' the nearest held room through a solid wall; a man on a room's threshold is in that room; and the HUD's
//     marker goes to the place he named when it is no room of the list. A man who has left the place he named says so once he has stopped ('moved — I'm in the
//     corridor now'); one who has gone after the team says he is out of it, and the marker comes off. Nobody is pinned to the room he named: the line follows
//     the man.
//   `regroup` — REGROUP AND DIG IN LOUDLY. At the close of a check the one who asked picks the room to make the stand in, by situation and never a die: a
//     room one of the answering men is holding, or the post one of them was staged on (the team not known to be in it, never entered) — the one MOST of
//     them are in or can reach, then the one with the most doors already wedged. A man can come if
//     he holds a post, nobody else has him (a squad about to give its word or with him out on a leg, the press, a door he is already working on), a squad
//     whose men stay in its rooms keeps to those, and his way there is at most `maxM` and does not pass within `clearM` of where the team was last seen or
//     heard; ties go to the most men already there, the farthest from the team, the least walking. He ORDERS it on the net, naming the room ('everybody to
//     the office — we hold it there!'), the men who come say so and run (pressure.ts `run` + `boots`: heard, and stopped by the room fight's own rules — an
//     enemy seen close and he fights where he is), a man with no way says that and where he digs in instead. In the room every man digs in through digin.ts —
//     furniture hauled and wedged under the doors (scrapes and thuds, any door of that room, squads' barricade lists or not), a spot off the door's line, set
//     on it and STEADY when it is booted — and they stay set: no standing down after the dig-in's `holdSecs`, no giving the room up through a door (cover
//     inside it still), no rally to a noise next door. When they are set one of them says so; from then one of them shores the wedge up every `thump` seconds
//     (a thud at the door, heard like any shoved furniture) and the check goes out with the room's name. A lone last man digs in where he stands;
//     a man out hunting (the room fight's 'free') is nobody's to order: he answers, and is counted, and is taken in once he holds a post again.
//     A man who arrives is the stand room's man for the room clear (roomclear.ts `rehome`): the room he left can clear behind him.
//   THE HUD. Under either switch the objective's marker sits on the first room still held that their net has NAMED, and the list brackets those rooms — what
//     the player has been told, not where the men truly are.
//   The die here is its own (mulberry32 off the room clear's seed and attempt): never Math.random. (digin.ts draws its own beats from Math.random as it always
//   has — once `regroup` has ordered a dig-in the run is a different run; `callOut` alone never is.)
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
