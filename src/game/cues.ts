// CUES — what the defenders decide, told to the player (the maintainer, 10-07, of defenders that hold their rooms after he is down: "maybe we just need more
// telegraphing from the NPCs then"; earlier "lean into unpredictability but with cues to be able to know what's happening"). Game.cues, behind `CUES.on`
// (off: nothing here runs, the radio strip is the 'radio: ' rows of Game.messages and every line is worded as it was).
//
// THIS FILE ONLY READS THE GAME. It writes nothing a man's AI, the dice or a digest reads: its rows and its bubbles live on the Cues object, never on a Guard
// (Guard.bubble is read by the bark clocks — suppression.ts, the stand-off's — and a line put there would move a die). A cue never moves a man.
//
//   1 · THE NET IS DELIVERED. A unit's radio line went into the log as '<callsign> (radio): …', which the strip (ui/overlay.ts)
//       never drew: no scenario defender's call ever reached the HUD. say() (guards.ts) now hands a room fight's defenders' radio lines here as well, and the
//       strip draws this file's rows (the team's own net, a showcase's cast and the night game's response are as they were). The rows are their own short
//       list: a line nothing draws can no longer push a drawn one out of the five-row message ring.
//   2 · PRIORITY AND RATE. About forty defender lines go out in a loud run and the strip has three rows of eight seconds. Every row has a CLASS (the order is
//       what a player would most want to know): 1 men coming round or coming to help · 2 stood down · 3 holding on purpose · 4 the net knows · 5 fell back
//       and planted · 6 alert but staying put (CLASSES for the lines they already had, by their words; LINES carries each new line's own). A squad's word
//       ranks a step ahead of a man's in its class. A row is NOT drawn when: the same words (whoever says them) went out inside `dupSecs`; two rows are up
//       and its class spoke inside its gap (`gaps`); the strip is full and every row up is better, or as good and not yet `minShow` old. A full strip gives
//       up, in order: the oldest row of a class holding more than `perClass` rows, the older of the new row's own class once it holds `perClass`, else the
//       worst-ranked row's oldest. A row that arrives squelches (once a frame).
//   3 · THE SILENT DECISIONS GET WORDS (LINES — one table). Each is read off what the man has already done, the frame he did it: the room fight's own notes
//       (RoomFight.log — the squads' and the press's come through it) and each defender's state. Nothing is said that he is not doing.
//         help       he leaves his room for the fight next door (he shouts it, too)   net   'moving to the fight — the mess'
//         stayOurs   he hears his side hit next door and the dice say stay            net   'they're hit in the mess — staying on my door'
//         stay       … or nobody of his side is posted where it came from             net   'shots outside the store — holding my room'
//         huntOver   his hunt is over, he holds where it ended                        net   'lost them — holding outside the store'
//         calm       he lowers his gun (state → patrol), still on his post            net   'quiet now — staying put'
//         cover      Sam is down at his feet: he keeps a gun on him                   net   'one of them down in the mess — covering him'
//         still      alert these `stillSecs` with nobody in sight, not moving         net   'they're still out there — holding the mess'
//         fellBack   he gives his room up (he shouts it, too)                         net   'the mess is lost — falling back'
//         planted    … and where he has set up again (pinnedIn: back in that room)    net   'fell back — set outside the mess'
//         squadHears a squad has word of the team and has not yet said what it does   net   'Bravo: copy, Alpha — stand by'
//         squadWaits … on Hard, a squad that could send men holds on purpose (drillNet)  net   'Bravo: copy, Alpha — hold, let them come in. Wait for my word!'
//         squadStays asked again, it stays on its doors                               net   'Bravo: still on the doors — nobody goes'

//       of a line of his own (bar the two he also shouts); the floor: KIND_GAP between two of a kind.
//   The one line that said what nobody then did — 'back to your posts', from a man whose side then stands where it is — is reworded for a unit (guards.ts),
