// A PEEK ROUND THE END OF A WALL LIFTS THE FOG OF WAR (the maintainer, from play on the police post, quiet, hard, the fog's cones: "peeking around a door …
// should let you see down the hallway").
//
// WHAT WAS THERE: with his back to a wall (Q), parked at an open end and still pushed toward it, the camera's look-at goes out past the corner and his neck
// cranes round it (player.ts moveOnWall: Player.wall.peek 0‥1) — but the man does not move, and the fog's eye for him is over his FEET (fogofwar.ts eyeOf:
// FogEye.at) looking where his head points: square off the wall into the room he stands in. So under the fog a peek showed the camera a hallway nobody's eye
// was in: dark, and no man in it drawn.
//
// THE RULE (PEEKSIGHT.on): while the peek is in, the fog's eye for the player is where a head leaned round that end would be — `out` metres past the end of
// the face, `off` metres off the wall's own plane (a head against the frame; never through the plane), at his own eye height — looking `turnDeg` round from
// 'along the wall' into the opening (90 = square through the doorway, past the corner). It comes in and goes with the peek's own ease, so the mask sweeps
// and does not pop. It REPLACES his own eye for as long as the peek is in (one head): under the cones the room behind his shoulder goes back under the fog
// but for the near field every eye has. Something solid standing in the way of the lean (a leaf swung across the end, a cabinet, a pane) stops the eye
// short of it. Looking under a door with the wand comes first, as it does over his own eye. On the rifle stack (wallsnap: he really steps out round the
// end, the rifle up) the same head position is measured from where he actually stands, and the look stays the rifle's own, which the player steers.
//
// KNOWN, NOT MENDED: the hold let go at full peek (stepping out round the end, Q, a takedown) puts the eye back over his feet in one frame, and on a face
// barely longer than he is wide the peek can change ends while it is still in: the mask jumps there, as the camera's own look-at does.
//
// NOT CHANGED: what anybody else sees. The guards' eyes go by his real head and chest, which stay on the wall: a peek exposes him no more than it did
// (probes.ts peek-sight digests the same run with the switch down and up, the guards live). Whether a head that is out should be a head that can be seen is
// the maintainer's call: it changes what guards see.
//
// No state of its own (read off Player.wall each frame), no dice, no clock. PEEKSIGHT.on: ON in the page (?peeksight=0), OFF here and on the frozen stand
// (TPS_PEEKSIGHT=1); a recording from before the table replays with it off (journal.ts).
