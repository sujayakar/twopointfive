// Suppression (docs/internal/sc20k-design.md §4, lane R3): ONE scalar per living character — Sam and every guard alike — raised by rounds that pass close to
// him or strike close to him, decaying with a half-life of about a second. It is fed from the one place a round exists, combat.ts fireWeapon, off the
// segment the hit scan actually traced (muzzle → where it stopped: a round that ended in the jamb in front of a man suppresses him from the jamb), and it is
// ballistic, not visual and not acoustic: no line-of-sight test, no route through SoundPaths, nothing inferred from anybody's AI state — who fired the round
// and where from ride on the round itself, nothing more. The guards' behaviour branches on it (guards.ts: a flinch, a worse and later shot, the head going down
// behind whatever he stands at, a shift to cover when it will not stop — all behind Game.tune.suppression); Sam's own rounds open up with his (player.ts, the
// one mechanical effect this lane gives him; his picture / mix / reticle are lane R4's, reading the same Player.sup). What the player learns by feel — two close
// rounds put a man's head down for a second and a half — is literally the guards' rule with these constants.
