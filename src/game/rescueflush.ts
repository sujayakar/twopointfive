// THE MEN LEFT ALIVE ON A RESCUE COME FOR THE HOSTAGES (RESCUEFLUSH; rescue.ts tick() / captor() / clock() ask here while the switch is up). The
// maintainer, 10-18: "remaining enemies should try to flush you out and/or kill the hostage when loud".
//
//   WHAT WAS THERE   the captor's clock passed to a man of theirs only if he happened to be standing in the hostage room; once the room was the team's, the
//                    men alive elsewhere (the door man in the corridor, a roamer who had hunted the noise and lost it, Hard's man on his crossfire) stayed
//                    where the fight had left them. Nobody came back for the hostages and nobody pushed the team off them.
//   THE RULE, once the team has been LOUD (a shot, a bang, a boot of its own: rescue.ts noiseAt) and the ROOM HAS FALLEN (every man posted in it is down):
//     THEY COME   `afterSecs` later the nearest man of theirs outside the room says so on their net and goes for the hostages; every `gapSecs` the next
//                 one follows — the first by the room's main door, the second by its side door where the level has one (two ways at once: the flush), and
//                 so on in turn. Each is let go the way a roamer is let go to the noise (the fight AI's own hunt of his `lastKnown`, the room fight's
//                 'free'): his eyes, his grenades and his pursuit drills are his own, he stops and fights whoever he meets, and the walk is priced and
//                 gated by the covered lanes like any other. The lanes only CHOOSE his door (`lanesChoose`; lanes.ts laneCovers asked of the floor
//                 outside each door: his turn's door in their line of fire and the other not, he takes the other); nobody is kept back for being
//                 warned off — where he is sent is where the team's guns are, so a man kept back for a lane at those guns never came at all.
//                 Stopped short of a covered corridor on his way he is that rule's (he looks, goes round or throws as its men do), and while it
//                 holds him there no word takes him off it for what lies at that corridor's guns (laneHolds).
//     AND AGAIN   a man who has come to rest with nobody in his sights (the room fight planted him again) is sent again `againSecs` after his last word.
//     THEY'RE GONE   the first of them to stand in the hostage room and find no hostage in it says so on the net, and from then on they go where a man
//                 taking people out of the building goes: the team's last loud thing and the way out (the team's own way in), in turn.
//     THE GUN ON HER   a man of theirs with a clear line to a living hostage inside `reachM` HAS her, as the man standing in the room always did
//                 (rescue.ts captor()): the clock is his. One who came for her is `killSecs` from turning his gun on her, then RESCUE.aimSecs from the
//                 round — the same act, broken the same ways (shot, blinded, staggered, grabbed, or one of the team standing in the line). So a
//                 hostage on her feet behind the team is safe only while nobody of theirs is left a line to her.
//   Never: a response from outside (another rule's), more health, a man who knows where the team is without having heard or seen it (the three places
//   he is sent are the room he was guarding, a noise his side heard, and the door the team came in by).
//
// Off (the module's default, the frozen stand) = the build as it was. On in the page (host/profile.ts pageSwitches; ?norescueflush) and on the shipped
// stand; TPS_RESCUEFLUSH=1 raises it on a frozen run. UNTUNED by play.
