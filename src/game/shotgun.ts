// THE BREACHING SHOTGUN (gear, 10-08 — the maintainer: "more gear (eg frag grenades)"; weapons.ts row 'm870'): a pump gun a teammate's loadout card hands him in
// place of his rifle (kit.ts), and that you may bring in place of the FN2000. Two things make it a shotgun and both live here:
//
//   A SHELL IS NINE ROUNDS. fireShell is what combat.ts fireWeapon becomes for a row with `pellets` (weapons.ts PelletSpec): every pellet goes through fireWeapon
//   itself — the game's own hit scan, the same walls, leaves, furniture, panes and bodies, a hole and a puff where each stops — the first down the bore as the
//   shooter's hands hold it (it carries the shell's one flash, report and hearing event), the rest drawn evenly over a disc round that line. What it does to a
//   man is the PATTERN's doing, never a count kept on him: inside `dropM` any one pellet puts him down; past it only `need` or more of ONE shell do, and a man
//   caught by fewer is peppered (launcher.ts staggerGuard: doubled over a second and a half, alert, standing). The disc is a metre across at eight metres and
//   three across at twenty-five, so the same rule that is near certain in a room is a poor bet down a corridor — tools/qa/shotgun-probes.ts prints the curve.
//   Of the nine, every third counts as a round going past a head (suppression.ts) and as a round into the beaten zone (destruction.ts): a shell is loud, it is
//   not thirty rounds of automatic fire. GLASS (glasspen.ts, the shell rule; rebuild/gear-and-glass/pellets.md): every pellet that meets a pane marks it —
//   through it or spent in it alike — except where it lands on a mark this same shell has already made there (`glass` on the Shell): nine pellets through one
//   spot are one ragged hole, and a muzzle pressed to the glass files one crossing, not nine.
//
//   IT TAKES A LOCK. `need` or more pellets of one shell into a LATCHED leaf within `latchM` of its latch edge, from a muzzle no more than `reachM` off, and the
//   keep is gone and the leaf goes in — doors.ts kickIn, the boot's own verb: a steel door rings and holds, the crack carries like the boot's, the lock is
//   broken for the rest of the run. That is true for whoever fires it and only of a leaf that is LOCKED: you, with the muzzle on the lock, and the man the door tools send (doortools.ts: a stack
//   whose man carries one takes a locked door with it from beside the frame instead of the boot from in front of it — `carriesBreacher` / `breachSpot` below). A door wedged from inside (digin.ts) has no keep to shoot: that one stays the boot's.
//
// With no such row in anybody's hands nothing here runs: fireWeapon's one test of `def.pellets` is the whole cost, and a run digests as it did.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
