// QUIET MISSIONS UNDER THE FOG OF WAR — the fog lever's own rungs on a quiet mission's row, 'off' (every guard shown) the bottom one.
//
// The maintainer, 10-11: "stealth missions don't have fog of war" · "i think we should make it part of the fog of war difficulty slider" · "will need to
// playtest a bunch". A quiet mission (alone, or as two) never ran under the fog: scenarioRun.ts fogOfQuery raised it for a room clear and a rescue only, and
// the mission sheet greyed the fog lever on a quiet row. Now the lever is live there and has one more rung at the bottom, OFF — every guard shown,
// the quiet missions as they were, and where they all started until 10-13 (WHERE A QUIET MISSION STARTS, below) — and the three rungs above it are the squad lever's own (difficulty.ts FogRung): all round, cones, own
// eyes. Moved up, that quiet mission's link carries `quietfog=<rung>` and the mission is played under the fog at that rung.
//
// ITS OWN PICK, NOT THE SQUAD LEVER'S: what this machine keeps for the squad missions (difficulty.ts SET.fog — 'own eyes', say) is not put on a quiet mission
// by itself, and the quiet pick is not put on a squad mission. Kept per machine under its own key; one pick for every quiet mission. A Training lesson is
// taught on the level as it is: no rung there.
//
// WHAT THE RUNG WRITES: nothing of the fog's own files. At the mission's start the rung is laid on the fog's two rows for the visit (FOG.cone through
// difficulty.ts setConeVisit, FOG.own directly) and let go of when the scenario is quit; `?fogcone` / `?fogown` on the same URL speak over it, as they speak
// over the squad lever. The fog's eyes are the ones it always had: the player, and a partner where there is one.
//
// THE SWITCH: `QUIETFOG.on` — ON in the page (`?quietfog=0` = the lever greyed on a quiet row and no rung read, as it was), OFF in the module and on the
// frozen harness stand (`TPS_QUIETFOG=1`). Off, or the rung 'off', is the build as it was: every guard shown, nothing of the fog's written.
//
// WHERE A QUIET MISSION STARTS (`QUIETFOG.def`; the maintainer's pick, 10-13: "i think it should be fog + teammate (maybe they have some way to see each
// other's headset camera, like the sticky cams) + we find a way to balance sticky cams"): the rung a quiet mission is played on when this machine keeps no
// pick and its link names none. 'team' in the page — the fog, lifted round you and round your partner, with the mission's sticky cameras handed out
// (`?quietdef=off` = every quiet mission starts with all guards shown, as before the pick) — 'off' in the module and on the frozen stand
// (`TPS_QUIETDEF=team`). A LINK SAYS ONLY WHAT DIFFERS FROM THE DEFAULT: at 'team' a bare quiet link is the fog with cameras, `quietfog=off` is all shown,
// `cams=0` the fog with none; at 'off' the links are the ones this file always wrote. The store likewise keeps a pick only where it differs. A Training
// lesson is on 'off' whatever the default. A recording from before the key replays with 'off' (journal.ts).
//
// THE SOLO NIGHT TOO (`QUIETFOG.solo`; the maintainer, 10-17, from the kit screen of the solo night, where the cameras and the wand read 'no use here':
// "for the solo night missions we should have fog of war! then you really need the sticky cams"). What was there: only a link that names a room clear, a
// rescue or a quiet mission's rung raised the fog (scenarioRun.ts fogOfQuery); the solo night's link (`?solo`, no scenario on it) named none, so the plain
// night always ran with every guard shown and nothing for a camera to look into. With the switch up the solo night's link is read as a quiet row's is:
// the same rungs, the same pick this machine keeps for its quiet missions, the same default (QUIETFOG.def), the mission's cameras and its wand handed out
// with the fog, `quietfog=off` on the link = every guard shown. Only the link `solo` with no scenario, showcase or lesson beside it: a page stood up
// plain (the floor under a title card, a showcase, a harness game) is as it was. ON in the page (`?solofog=0`), OFF here and on the frozen stand
// (`TPS_SOLOFOG=1`); a recording from before the key replays with it off (journal.ts). Nothing here makes the night harder by numbers: the guards, their
// eyes and the level are untouched.
