// Sam's low whistle (V) — Chaos Theory's "psst": a small deliberate noise to pull ONE man off his line and over to where you were. It is a GameEvent like every
// other sound ('whistle', level WHISTLE.level, at Sam's feet, who = the player) and it reaches the guards through the SAME propagation the mixer and every other
// event use (collision.ts SoundPaths: straight through the air, round the corner along the walkable space and in through the doorway, or dully through a shut
// leaf) — guards.ts hearingCheck hands each man's copy to hearWhistle below. What it does to them:
//   · every living man within WHISTLE.horizon (straight line) whose propagated path is shorter than reachK × carry (× the alarmed floor's keener ear) HEARS it:
//     ~8 m of open air, ~5.8 m round a corner, ~2.6 m through a shut door — the numbers the probes print (tools/qa/whistle-probes.ts);
//   · of the calm men who hear it (patrol / suspicious, on nobody's errand, not choreographed, not in Sam's arm) only the NEAREST by path answers: a line from a
//     small pool, half a second to place it, then he walks over to where it came from — the doorway or corner it came through if it was routed — and looks
//     about, exactly the suspicion a creaking door gives him (awareness 0.45: he talks himself out of it on arrival), torch still in hand, nothing on the net;
//     the others who heard it turn their heads that way for a second and a half and carry on;
//   · the same man answering a SECOND whistle inside twiceWindow seconds stops being polite: a proper search of that area (the 'search' state and its plan of
//     hiding places round the point, gun out), still without a word on the radio unless the search finds something;
//   · a man already hunting (alert / search) takes it as one more fix on where you are — no line, no change of state; a man about to go loud anyway (a shot in the
//     same half second) is not talked down to 'hello?' by it.
// The player's side (whistleKey / tryWhistle): V, anywhere but down, once per `cooldown` seconds — the event, the sound meter's tick, the synthesized two-note
// voice at his head (sfx.ts 'whistle'); no HUD line, it is diegetic. The knobs (WHISTLE) sit in Tab ▸ Sandbox and are kept per machine like the aim rows.
