// The issue kit: 2010s GWOT in place of the first Splinter Cell clone (the maintainer, 10-10: "and maybe start reworking to gwot 2010s? we can move away from the
// first SC clone for equipment. bifocal nvg, more standard rifles and handguns, etc." · "we can keep OCP tho" · "and i don't think we need the NVG to glow in
// the dark"). ONE switch, `GEAR.on` — ON in the page (`?oldgear` = the Splinter Cell kit as it was), OFF in the module and on the frozen harness stand
// (`TPS_GEAR=1`; src/host/profile.ts pageSwitches + FROZEN_HOLDS, src/host/standup.ts). What it changes is WHAT THE KIT IS CALLED AND HOW IT IS DRAWN, nothing a
// round, an eye, an ear or a hand reads — with ONE exception, the maintainer's own balance call (10-10: "yeah switch to 15 rounds for the glock, 40mm sponge
// round sgtm (and redo the assets), and just call it the mk18"): the Glock's magazines hold fifteen (GEAR_MAG):
//   · the rifle row reads Mk 18 (weapons.ts fn2000: name / short), drawn as a carbine with a stock, a box magazine AHEAD of the grip, a railed handguard and a
//     laser box on it (rigProps.ts RIG.m4) — on the SAME grip, support hand, muzzle, light and sling points as the bullpup, which the animator, the rounds, the
//     light and the launcher keep reading off RIG.sc20k: the simulation cannot tell the two apart;
//   · the pistol row reads Glock 19, 9×19 mm (weapons.ts fiveseven: name / short / calibre) and its magazines hold 15, in the gun and in the pouches (the
//     row's magCapacity getter; 10 without the kit) — cadence, reload, spread and report are untouched. A gun is LOADED when it is made (a fresh encounter)
//     and a magazine keeps the rounds it was loaded with: thrown on a running game, the switch changes what a magazine may hold from the next reload on
//     (Firearm.fit, which the Tab row calls, puts away what no longer fits when the kit comes off); a checkpoint's counts are kept, clamped to the row's;
//   · the goggles are two tubes on a bridge (rigProps.ts gogglesBoxes) whose lenses are dark glass, up or down: nothing on a man lights up;
//   · the rifle's first attachment is worded AND DRAWN a 40 mm sponge round — a blunt slug, blue foam nose on a dark body, nose first in the air and on its
//     side where it stops (throwables.ts SPONGE_ITEM / spongeBoxes: three boxes, as the ring's three slats, under the ring's own flags) — on the ring airfoil's
//     rule, flight, item and numbers exactly; the kit column's second launcher tag reads HE (shellTag);
//   · the OCP stays on the pistol, in name and in deed.
// KNOWN, LEFT: the empty magazine a reload drops still leaves from behind the trigger hand (player.ts: where an item is born is simulation state, and the
// same-digest claim wins over the picture); the support hand itself works the carbine's marks (anim.reloadBack false: arms only).
// Off = the build as it was: the words, the boxes and the magazine's size are picked where they are read, so a table put back (knobs.ts knobsBack) needs nothing re-applied.
// A LEAF: nothing of the game is imported here (src/game is one import cycle; weapons.ts, itself a leaf, reads this at call time).
