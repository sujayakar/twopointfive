// A SPRINT INTO A DOOR HAS WEIGHT (the maintainer, 10-13, while playing: "sprinting through a door needs some work, maybe bashing the door (and keeping a lot
// of momentum) if it opens out, kicking the door if it's the other way?").
//
// What a run at an unlocked door was: the leaf flung at 7.5 rad/s with the loud 'bash' and not a centimetre a second off his run — from EITHER face: the one it
// opens toward was hauled round through his own body at the same speed for the same nothing. A door weighed nothing and had no front or back to a runner.
// Now, for the player at a sprint (a teammate at a run — teampace.ts — and a guard at one are as a running man always was):
//   · THE FACE IT OPENS AWAY FROM — a shoulder through it (`bashed`): the leaf leaves his shoulder at `bashVel` (faster than he runs: it leads him), he keeps
//     `keep` of his speed square on (a glancing shoulder costs less: the share is taken off the part of his run that went INTO the leaf) and has it back by the
//     sprint's own acceleration, about a quarter of a second; his body turns the shoulder nearer the latch into it for `leanSecs`, his head staying on the run.
//   · THE FACE IT OPENS TOWARD — A BOOT AT THE RUN (the maintainer's pick, 10-14, with the handle rip built and played: "Make it a kick"). A frame holds an
//     ordinary boot from that face (doors.ts DOORWAY.frameHolds — his own rule, and it stands for every other boot); a man's whole run behind the sole is the
//     exception: the leaf goes THROUGH its frame, off its hinges, away from him (doorblast.ts tearOff — the loose slab a charge makes of it, thrown `kickK` as
//     hard; with no room beyond the frame to lie in, that module's own rule: flat to the far wall and back down through its doorway — it hurts nobody), as
//     loud as any kicked door, and the door is gone for the night. A leaf somebody opens under the wind-up is not kicked at all. He plants a stride short of it (sprintDoorKick sees the leaf coming: the kick
//     starts at the kicking distance plus what his speed carries him, so he is eased FORWARD onto the spot; a run begun too near the leaf for that is the handle), is
//     rooted for the blow and has his legs again `kickFree` seconds in (never before half a second: the blow lands at 0.38); the sprint comes back by itself with Shift still held.
//     Where a boot cannot do that — the frame rule off or a show on the stage, a steel door, a leaf standing ajar off its frame, doors that never come off
//     (DOORBLAST.on false), the run too slow or too glancing to be a kick, `kick: false` — it is THE HANDLE, as first built: he checks to `ripPace` of the
//     sprint (about a walk), rips it round at `ripVel` — quicker than a walked pull, quieter than a shoulder (`ripLevel`) — and the run comes back after
//     `ripSecs`. The leaf passes him as a pulled leaf passes anyone (the one-way doors' pull).
//   · LOCKED against him: as it was — the kick from the face it opens away from, a wall from the other (game.ts updateDoors, doors.ts): a lock still means
//     a pick, a key or a charge from that face.
// The two stamps it keeps are on the Player (doorBashAt / doorBashLean / doorRipUntil) and ride a checkpoint while one is running (savestate.ts); a kick under
// way is the Player's own `kick`, and `doorKickTail` while its leg is still coming down with his legs already his own: a checkpoint is refused through both.
//
// `on`: ON in the page (src/host/profile.ts pageSwitches; ?nosprintdoor = a run at a door as it was), OFF in the module and on the harness's frozen stand
// (TPS_SPRINTDOOR=1). Off = no contact carries `run`, nothing here is read: the build as it was. Never under a show or with the puppet's strings on him.
