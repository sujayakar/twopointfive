// TEAMMATES' FRAGS AND STUN CANISTERS, THROWN ON ORDER — "frag there" / "bang there".
//
// The maintainer (10-13): "would be nice to be able to instruct teammates to throw frags/stuns". Until here a teammate's grenade left his hand only as part
// of a door order (bang and clear, frag and clear). Here the squad has two counted orders on a spot of FLOOR, behind one row of the floor's menu:
//
//   X on a spot of floor · G ('throw ▸', a page) · 1 = frag there · 2 = bang there.      Nothing held, no digit above 2 on the page, Esc / right click = back.
//
// THE COUNT is the door tools' own (doortools.ts `frags` / `bangs`: one bag, whoever's hand it leaves) — what the squad block already shows. No kit of its own.
// WHO THROWS: of the men the menu goes to, the nearest with a throw to the spot — squadsmoke.ts's own test (`squadArcTo`: the hand, the arc solved to bring the
// thing to REST on the spot, down on the floor, its run clear) and its own exclusions (`squadHandFree`) + `handsBusy` (the man setting a charge, on a door's
// handle or boot, with a hand on a thing he works, or changing a magazine is passed over), a stun canister with the smoke can's run (one body:
// throwables.ts) and a frag with its own (SQUADTHROW.fragRollK, measured). The rows are `free` and `only` the thrower's: nobody else answers.
// HE WORKS HIS THROW OUT (SQUADTHROW.lob / duck / samCall; the maintainer, 10-15: "ordering your squad to throw a grenade is still pretty useless. they should
// figure out how to throw to a spot"). Measured on the office, the four holding by the player: a frag was refused on 88 % of the floor he could see ('you are
// in it.': a frag reaches 9 m) and had no throw to two spots in three of the rest. Three rules, each its own key under the switch: `lob` — where the straight
// arc has no answer a man flies a few throws in his head (throwplan.ts: the pool's own flight) and takes one that goes off by the spot — another pace, a
// bank off a wall beside it — from where he stands, else from floor he walks to; `duck` — a man of ours who will be off a frag's line before it bursts (the
// squad steps off its own frag: frag.ts fragFlee) is not a reason to refuse it, nor to pass over floor to throw from; `samCall` — a frag that reaches the
// player alone is his call, named on the row. The order of asking: the straight arc from where a man stands, a worked-out throw from where a man stands,
// a walk to the straight arc, a walk to a worked-out throw.
// A MAN WITH NO THROW WALKS TO ONE (SQUADTHROW.walk; the maintainer, 10-13: "it would be good to have the squad move to do a throw (and maybe visualize who's
// doing it and the path on the ground?)"). Where nobody addressed has a throw from where he stands, `walkSpot` floods the walk grid out from each man who may
// be walked off (hand free; no drill, door tool or wall charge has him; not in a fight; under no order or one he can be handed back: move / stack / cover /
// hold / fall in) — over floor the squad knows, never through a shut leaf, at most `walkM` — and takes the FIRST cell (the fewest steps: the edge of where a
// throw opens, not the middle of it) from which the same arc test passes for a man standing there, he himself outside what it does, and the orders' router
// has a way. He is walked there by `SquadOrders.assign` under the row's own id (so anything that draws an order's man, way and mark draws this), the can
// still in the bag; on the spot he turns to it, the sense above is asked again of the floor as it stands, the can is taken and thrown, and (`back`) he walks
// back to where he stood and to the order he had. Stopped short, he looks once more for a spot from where he is; nothing = his word and back. Any other order
// to him ends it (nothing thrown, nothing spent). Off = 'no throw from here.', as it was.
// THE PICTURE (`squadThrowPlans`, drawn by ui/squadthrowviz.ts on the overlay behind SQUADTHROW.draw): who throws (a ring at his feet in his element's
// colour), his walk, the arc, where it rests — for the highlighted row while the throw page is up, and from the order until the thing leaves his hand.
// THE THROW is the door tools' own: the frag on FRAG.orderFuse from the hand, the canister on combat.ts flashFuse from its landing, the quick toss, his word
// ('frag out!' / 'bang out!'). Each goes off by the game's own road (combat.ts updateItems → frag.ts / detonateStun) under the thrower's id: nothing borrowed.
// SENSE, asked when the menu is read and again as the order is given (nothing is spent on a refusal):
//   none left · no arc for anybody addressed · A FRAG NEVER ONTO ITS OWN: the player, any teammate still breathing (the thrower too; a man down wounded or out cold counts), a hostage, the man to take
//   alive or a civilian inside the reach the door tools ask of a frag (FRAG.woundM + 1, a line by frag.ts exposedTo) of where it would rest or of the spot
//   itself = refused, naming who. A STUN is not refused for its own side — it is the player's call — but its row NAMES who of ours it would catch
//   (' · too close: you, Red One'), by detonateStun's own tests asked from where it would rest and from the spot, each reach a metre long: it may over-warn.
// A SILENT squad: both rows are silent.ts LOUD_ROWS (marked, and giving one takes the squad out of silent).
// THE SQUAD BLOCK shows the throw for SQUADTHROW.shownSecs ('Red Two · frag out').
//
// SQUADTHROW.on: off in the module and on the frozen stand; on in the page (host/profile.ts). The rows are put on / taken off the menu by squadThrowKey, once
// a frame, so a switch thrown live holds from the next frame. Off, and never on for this Game: one map read a frame. On with nothing ordered: rows on a menu.
//
// State is per Game in a WeakMap: whether the rows are on, each man's last throw (the toss has to finish), what the squad block is showing, the stun row's
// warning as last read. None of it is in a checkpoint — none is taken with a unit on the floor, and all of it is seconds old at most. No dice of its own:
// the thrown thing draws the game's die as any thrown item does (throwables.ts spawn). 'Nobody of ours in it' is asked AT THE THROW, of where each stands then.
// Check: tools/qa/squadthrow-check.ts (`probes.ts squadthrow`).
