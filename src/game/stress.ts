// EXTRA ENEMIES (a stress hook: `?extra=N`, Tab ▸ Sandbox ▸ Stress, __extra, tools/qa/enemy-ceiling.ts) — N more hostile men stood on the floor that is up, to
// SEE what more of them cost: the frame on a real GPU (the read-out's fps / gpu ∪, `?hud`) and the simulation's step. The answer to 'how many enemies can this
// take' is a measurement, and the cloud that wrote this has no GPU — this is the one-minute way to make it on a machine that has.
//
// OFF BY DEFAULT, AND NOTHING WHEN OFF: nothing here is called from Game.update. The page calls stressTick once a frame (a return on its first line while no
// count is asked for); the harness never calls it. With no `?extra` and the button unpressed the game is the game exactly.
//
// WHAT IT STANDS: ordinary hostile units through spawnUnit — the same men the scenarios stage, held and pinned on a spot with their guns on a door — so the room
// fight, the hard defenders' rules, the fog of war and the team's eyes treat them as the staged defenders. Under a ROOM CLEAR they are dealt to the structure's
// rooms in turn (a room's unused marks first, then free floor inside it) and ADOPTED by the scenario (nightbreach.ts / roomclear.ts adopt: its lists, so a room
// they hold is not 'clear' and the structure is not 'taken' while one is up). Anywhere else (the plain floor, the night breach, the rescue) they stand on free
// floor away from Sam and are nobody's bookkeeping.
//
// IT DOES NOT LIFT A CAP. spawnUnit is asked with the skinning's budget (sixteen characters all told — bodies, hostages and civilians included): the men that
// fit are stood and the first refusal is kept in words (`STRESS.last`, the panel's line) — so on The block (Sam + four + eight) three more fit, eleven enemies. More than that is renderer
// work (rebuild/enemy-squads/ceiling.md has the caps); `spawn` is the seam the HEADLESS tool uses to stand men past them where nothing is drawn.
// A restart under a scenario despawns every unit and stages its own cast again: stressTick stands the asked-for count again on the fresh staging. Switching it
// off stops that; the men already standing leave at the next restart (they are in the scenario's lists). While they stand they are UNITS ON THE FLOOR: the
// showcases and the checkpoints refuse, as they do for any response unit — a stress floor is for looking at the frame's cost, not for playing a run through.
