// AN ENEMY ON ALERT DOES NOT SIT BLIND IN THE DARK (the maintainer, 10-13, from play: "i do think enemies are a bit too comfortable in the dark when they know
// adversaries are out there. if they can't see around them (do we model that?), they should use their flashlight if they have it. if they don't have one they
// should stumble around to somewhere with light (?)").
//
// WHAT WAS MODELLED: an eye's sight of a man goes by the light ON THAT MAN (guards.ts sightGain / sightGainOn: detectRate × light^1.5 …) — nothing asks how much the
// watcher himself can see, and nobody acted on it. The level's own staff burn a light whenever they are not calm, but a mission's defenders (hostile units:
// rescue.ts, nightbreach.ts, stress.ts) are dealt their weapon lights OFF (`defLights` false) and never touch them: a man who has heard the door go stands at his
// mark, gun on a doorway he cannot see a shape in, and waits.
//
// THE RULE, for a living enemy unit whose light the mission left off, once he KNOWS and is BLIND:
//   · KNOWS, for good = his own senses have had it: he has been alert or searching, or gunfire, a kick or a bang has reached him (his witness record). KNOWS, for
//     now (`word`) = `byLamp`, the burning lamp of a mate WHO KNOWS is in his view (his cone, a clear line, `lampM`): a lamp going on
//     down a corridor is the word. A lamp lit on the word passes none on (no ring of lamps keeps itself lit) and goes out when that view is lost or lit.
//   · BLIND = the floor he is watching is dark: along his aim and `fanRad` either side of it, every `stepM` out to `lookM` or the first wall, less than `seeShare`
//     of the floor reads `litAt` or over on the meter's scale by the place's steady light and anybody's carried light but HIS OWN (a mate's beam down his lane, the
//     team's own lights, light him a view; his own is left out so the answer does not chase the switch). A man in a dark room watching a lit doorway is NOT blind:
//     he has the better of it and stays as he was.
//   · HE CARRIES A LIGHT (`carry` of them, by his id: no dice): it comes on after `onSecs` (+ his id's share of `onJitter`: a room's lamps do not click as one),
//     and goes off after `offSecs` (stretched by his id) of a lit view or of not knowing, never twice inside `holdSecs`. ONE MODEL: it is the same weapon light
//     every unit has — the meter reads it, it lights him and the room for the player, and pointed at an eye it gives him away (roomfight.ts lampGlare). That
//     trade is the point.
//   · HE CARRIES NONE (`seek`): after `blindSecs` of it, a defender who knows for good, is alert, holds a post the room fight gave him and whom
//     nothing else has (dig-in under way or set, his squad's word pending, a covered lane's mouth, a press, a buddy on his way; the captor; a last stand; Sam's
//     arm; magnesium; a script), with nobody in his eyes for `quietSecs`, no shot heard for `calmSecs` and no rounds going past him, walks — at `stumbleK` of the
//     investigating pace — to the nearest floor IN HIS OWN ROOM he can see from, unless where he stands already is such floor: `edge` — the nearest spot still in
//     the dark with lit floor in plain view within `edgeM` (he stops at the dark edge of a pool of light, not under the lamp) — else the nearest the place's own
//     light reaches; failing that, to the shoulder of a mate in the room whose lamp is burning. Never by way of a doorway or out of the room (`roam` lifts that: off as shipped), never to a spot
//     nearer the trouble than he stands, a way no longer than `walkM`. The walk is the room fight's own 'move' leg (roomfight.ts tickMove: his senses run, a
//     man seen close stops him, where he gets to is his post and he is alert there — as he was: only an alert man is sent, so the walk raises no
//     alarm of its own). At most `moves` such walks a man, `againSecs` apart.
//   · WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: a man with no light whose room has no lit floor and no lamp in it stays where he is, blind, as before.
// Nothing here gives anybody better eyes, aim or health: the eye, the meter and the sight gain are untouched.
// No dice, no camera, no graphics setting, no wall clock: the CPU's light estimate, counted seconds. Per-man state rides darkFoeSnapshot / darkFoeRestore (units
// are in no checkpoint today — savestate.ts canSave refuses with one on the floor — so nothing calls the pair but the check).
// Type-only game imports but for functions used inside calls (src/game is one import cycle).
