// HANDS THAT DO THE WORK — the three biggest gaps on the missing-animations audit, closed with small layers (character.ts workLayer / radioLayer / swapLayer;
// nothing here is a clip):
//
//   WORK   one "working at a thing" pose, fed wherever a man already stands at something and uses it: Sam keying a door code (a forefinger on the pad's own keys,
//          the beeps on its presses), a charge going on a door or a wall (Sam's and a teammate's), the mains breaker (Sam's hand throws the lever — the lights go
//          WITH the hand; a guard re-arming it), the objective coming out of its rack (both hands, then away at his hip). Sam is walked the step in to arm's length
//          and squared to the thing for as long as the verb runs, as he already was at a lock and a keypad; the trigger lets go of the drive and a charge — the
//          lever's half second is committed, like a kick (its row's deed is filed on the tap).
//   RADIO  a line that goes over the net (guards.ts say) lifts the speaker's left hand to the handset at his collar for about as long as the line.
//   SWAP   a guard's torch ↔ sidearm change is a move of his hand — torch to the belt, hand to the holster, gun up; and back — instead of a change on the frame.
//          The RULE (guards.ts handCarry) is untouched: what he may do with the gun, and when, is exactly what it was, and his BORE and MUZZLE are read off the
//          arm UNDER the swap (character.ts handPre): a line of fire and a round's start are where they are with it off; a shot mid-draw jumps the move's end.
//
// One switch, HANDWORK.on — the page: on (`?nohandwork` off); the frozen harness stand: off (`TPS_HANDWORK=1` on) — and its three halves for A/B on the panel.
// What changes for the SIMULATION with it on (so the frozen stand holds it off): Sam's breaker takes the half second his hand needs, a code waits for his finger
// to reach the pad, and he is planted while he pulls the drive / sets a wall charge / throws the breaker. The radio hand and the guards' swap move nothing of
// the game but what the picture shows: the torch's beam goes to the belt with the hand for the swap's third of a second, and a man whose gun is DOWN tips his
// head to his handset as he does for a tell (his eyes go with it); with his sights up the head stays. A man dropped mid-swap falls from the arm UNDER the swap
// (character.ts underPose: he lies where he lies with it off); one dropped with his hand at his radio falls as he was drawn. The animator's clocks are not in a
// checkpoint (as no layer's are): a load mid-swap finds the hand already there.
//
// State: none of its own beyond two fields on the Player (breakerMove, handWait — a save is refused while either runs: savestate.ts playerBusy); everything else
// is fed a frame at a time and lives in the animator, like every other layer's clocks.
