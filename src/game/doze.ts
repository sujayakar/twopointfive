// DOZING IN THE DARK — a calm guard in an unlit room has a reason to be there (the maintainer, 2026-10-13: "i wonder if we even just want to have guards
// sleeping in dark rooms or something like that. like snoozing off in a chair. it should make sense why they're hanging out when they can't see.").
//
// BEFORE: a staff man whose route has him WAIT in a place with no light stood there on his feet and stared into the black for the length of the wait.
// NOW (DOZE.on): a calm staff man who comes to a wait of `minWait` to `maxWait` seconds at a waypoint where the place is dark by the calm torch's own reading
// (calmtorch.ts workLit) and the floor he faces is dark too (darkfoe.ts darkFoeBlind: a man in the dark watching a LIT door is a picket, and stays one), with a free chair within `chairM` that is in the dark too, walks to the chair, sits down in it (close.ts closeSeat: the seated man the
// close-in mode already takes 'over a chair') and nods off: head down, torch dark, a 'z' over him that grows with his breath. His wait clock RUNS the whole time,
// so the level's timetable is close to what it was (not equal: he gets up at the chair, not at his stand, and leaves a second or two late): `riseSecs` before the wait is over he stretches, gets up and walks his route on.
//
// ASLEEP his eyes are shut (he sees nobody, no body, no light going out: guards.ts canSeeChar / pointInView / bodySeen ask dozeAsleep, so every reader of a
// man's eyes has it) and his ears are dull: guards.ts hearingCheck runs for him as for anybody, its small noises at `hearK` of a waking man's. WHAT WAKES HIM:
//   noise   anything hearingCheck counts at that bar: gunfire, a charge or a door kicked in (as loud to him as to anybody), a whistle that is his to answer
//           (whistle.ts: the nearest calm man in its reach), a door or furniture noise, glass, an enemy's footfall — a crouched step never does, a walking
//           step does beside his chair, a run does across the room
//   light   `lightAt` on the meter's scale on his face for `lightSecs` from anything but his own side's lamps: a weapon light, the room's lights coming on
//   bump    his chair shoved by anybody
//   the floor going up (an alarm, a body called in over the net, the mains cut: he is up with the rest, by their rules)
// A man woken by noise, light or a bump is SUSPICIOUS from the frame he wakes (`wakeAw`), placed on what woke him, rooted `stirSecs` while he comes round — and he
// does not doze again that run: the room has an awake man in it from then on. Taken from behind in his chair he never wakes at all. Asleep he says nothing and
// calls nobody on the radio (needs.ts partnerReply, guards.ts radioCaller / spokesman); he does count in on the radio check, eyes shut (one log line).
//
// AT A SCREEN (the maintainer's steer, the same day: "working on a computer in a dark room (with their face illuminated by light) could be a reasonable
// setting. it'd also interact with their attention being on the screen (and maybe even headphones on?) so they'd be less perceptive. and some probably some
// opportunities for funny writing too."). Where the chair is at one of the level's screens (a switchable in group 'monitors', the chair on its lit side) the
// same wait can be sat out AT it: he shifts the chair (`pullM` at most, to where a man facing the screen has room for his feet — which may be a hand AWAY from it), sits FACING it, switches it
// on if it was off — its light is on his face and in the room: a light like any other, to the meter and to every eye — and is at work: awake, eyes open and
// on the screen (he sees what is in front of him, which is the screen), headphones on (hearingCheck at `noises` for the small noises, `ears` for a footfall:
// dozeEar), a '♪' over him until something has reached him, and now and then a word for what is on it (SCREEN_LINES: a bubble, no radio, no log row; no line
// twice on the floor until all have been said). A wait under `napWait` prefers the screen, a longer one the sleep — one chair can be both. He is up for what
// gets any seated man up (a noise that does reach him: the net of awareness 0.3; a shove of his chair; the alarm; the mains — the screen dies with them),
// and for the screen going dark under his eyes ('light': up, looking at it). Got up by any of those, hauled out of the chair or put down in it, he leaves the screen ON, and it
// stays on (LEFT) for `idleSecs` with nobody at it, then blanks — or until the next man who sits to it gets up at the end of his wait: he switches it off. At the end of his wait a man
// switches off what he switched on, gets up and walks on, and the chair stays where he pulled it. `DOZE.screen` false = no screens: the men doze or stand,
// as before it (a recording from before the key replays so: journal.ts). THE SEAM with the attention rule (attention.ts, another goal's):
// how held attention narrows a man's EYES is that rule's. This file lends it the screen each frame he is at work (attentionLend, `lend`): with that rule on, a man
// off to the side of the screen is taken in at its `sideK` and the floor shows the thread and the ring. The hold ends by that rule (a man at the edge of his
// eye who has his awareness to its `breakGain`, a step that reaches him) and is lent again `lentBackSecs` on if he is still sat; he stays SAT until this file's
// own 0.3. His EARS stay this file's (`ears` / `noises` through dozeEar; the lend passes 1 and 1), so the headphones count once and work with that rule's
// switch off. With it off, or `lend` off, his eyes are whole. That rule holds nobody on a loud squad floor (its own `able`), and it keeps the lend for a
// quarter second after the last call: a man got up at the end of his wait walks his first steps with the thread still on the dark screen.
//
// The switch: OFF in the module and on the harness's frozen stand (TPS_DOZE=1 raises it there); the page turns it on (host/profile.ts pageSwitches; ?nodoze = every
// man stands his wait, as it was). Off = the build as it was by run digest: every export below returns on its first line. It needs close.ts's seat (CLOSE.on).
// A recording from before the key replays with it off (journal.ts applyKnobs). CHECK: tools/qa/doze-check.ts (`probes.ts doze`; DOZE_BREAK=1 must fail).
// NEVER SEEN ON A GPU: the slump (character.ts `slump`), the chair under him, the 'z' and the '♪', the screen's light on a seated man's face and in the room,
// the chair pulled up are numbers nobody has looked at. He makes NO SOUND yet: a breath or a
// snore is the sound table's to add (dozeBreath below is its phase).
