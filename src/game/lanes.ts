// A LANE THAT COST THEM (the maintainer, 10-11: "enemies do seem to run into held corridors a bit too eagerly, especially when they've already taken fire. was
// pretty easy to just hold a hallway and pick them off").
//
// What made them walk in: every way a defender is SENT somewhere in a room fight (the stock rally, Hard's press and its flankers, a squad's errand, the fight
// AI's own chase) is the shortest walk, and the only memory of a place that cost them was tactics.ts's kill-zone DOORWAY — one door frame, 25 s, never asked by
// a man on a scripted leg. A hallway the team holds from one end is neither. So five men in turn took the same hall past the same bodies.
//
// A LANE = a stretch of floor one gun covers: the wedge from where the fire came FROM, along the line to where it LANDED, as far as that gun has a line of fire
// (the level's own geometry and the door leaves as they stand) — and, within `fieldM` of that gun, everything else it has a line of fire to: men who know
// where a gun is know what it looks at, so the second and third ways in to the same guns do not each cost a man. One is opened by what a side has SUFFERED there: a man of theirs dropped by a round, or rounds
// passing a living man (`roundK` each: two near misses are a man's worth). ONE MODEL: the lane is nothing to anybody until a fit man of that side KNOWS of
// it — the man the rounds passed, or a mate with a line to where it happened, or (later) a man who comes on the bodies — and has had `callSecs` to say so on
// their net. Cut down before he could: nobody knows, and the next man walks in as before.
//
// WHAT THEY DO INSTEAD, once it is known and for `secs` after it last cost them (longer for every man lost in it):
//   · COME ANOTHER WAY: its floor is `dear` in every walk a man of that side plans (guards.ts goTo — the fight AI's hunters and the scripted legs of a press,
//     a flank or a squad's errand alike), so a way round is taken wherever the level has one.
//   · HOLD BACK: a man whose way still lies down it stops at the last floor out of its line and holds there with his gun on its mouth (followPath's gate →
//     RoomFight.laneStop), and while he is held no press and no noise AT THOSE GUNS takes him off it (`laneHolds`: they would send him at the same guns by
//     the same way; a fight somewhere else may have him). Nobody who knows of the lane walks over to a fight at its guns BY HIMSELF, held or not (`laneWarns`
//     in the stock rally — the one-at-a-time feed); a press may still take a man who is not held: together, by its own way. A man caught standing in it off his own post while rounds are still coming down it gets out of the line, to floor the guns do not see even
//     shifted a stride. A doorway drill (tactics.ts) is not stacked on a jamb the guns see through the opening (`laneCovers`), nor run through a
//     doorway whose far side is in their line — unless the charge that goes in first will burst on those guns (`laneDoor`).
//   · GO ROUND: with two or more held at its mouths, after a breath one (two of four) is sent at where the fire comes from by a way that never shows him to
//     that gun — if the level has one; the rest keep the mouths.
//   · HOLD IT AT TWO ANGLES, WITH FIRE (`pin`): a way round that would show its man to the guns too long is taken as far as where they would first see him; he
//     sets there, and the men held on the lane take turns putting a snap burst down it from their corners at where the fire came from (`flankTick`, `pinStep`).
//   · USE WHAT THEY CARRY: a man at a mouth with a stun charge on him (Hard's kit) and the guns in a throw's reach puts it down the lane, and the men on its
//     mouths go in behind the bang while it lasts — behind any stun charge OF THEIRS that bursts on those guns with nothing solid between, the doorway
//     drill's too (`bangs`: a side knows its own cans; the holders' own sends nobody). And a man held on a lane with a FRAGMENTATION GRENADE on him (`frag`,
//     10-13) throws it at the middle of where the lane's fire came from, his arm round the corner he is held at (`fragOut`, `fragStep`): his own throw —
//     frag.ts — wants a fresh fix of his own and a line his rifle has lost, and a man held short of a lane has neither. Nobody goes in behind that one.
//
// HOW LONG: `secs` after it last cost them — or `movedSecs` after every gun that made it has cost them from somewhere well away (`movedM`), or is down: the
// guns have moved. Its floor is read again against the doors and walls as they stand, a wedge each half second (a door shut across it, a wall blown open).
// WHAT THEY KNOW OF THE GUNS is where rounds that cost them left the muzzle (the shot events' own start points, as tactics.ts reads them) — exact, where a man
// would have a rough idea; nothing is known of a gun that has not cost them.
//
// What it is NOT: no man added, no hit point, no better aim, no dice of its own (the one roll is the round's own spread, drawn by fireWeapon for a burst from a corner), nothing an enemy could not have seen or been told. Only defenders in
// a room fight (team 'hostile' units while the fight is live); never the night game, a show, or a teammate (he is under orders). `LANES.on` off = nothing here
// runs = the build by run digest; the frozen harness stand holds it off (TPS_LANES=1).
