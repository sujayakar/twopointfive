// A DOOR STACK KEEPS EVERY MAN INSIDE A ROOM. the maintainer, 10-10, the records office, the pair sent to the hall door with him on its latch jamb: "the guy on the
// left navigated to the *outside* and was pushing on the wall to try to get in. seems like a bug -- stacking on a door should always put everyone within a
// room. or maybe an adjacent one on the other side of the door if the room is too small". Measured on the build before this file (tools/qa/stackroom-check.ts):
// a pair with only one jamb free was dealt its second place a `fileGap` further along the wall with NOTHING asked of the floor there (orders.ts stackPostsOn's
// last line) — in a corner that is a point inside the side wall or beyond it, and a walk to a point beyond a wall ends on the wall's far side: the yard. The same
// held, more rarely, for a mark tucked along the wall (doortools.ts), a place stood back from a door (rearPosts), a charge's stand-off and the marks the men
// work out for a jambless face: each was asked for floor and a line to the doorway's front, never WHOSE floor — a line through the next doorway standing open
// is a line, and its far side is another room.
//
//   THE FACE'S FLOOR   the nav cells a man can walk to from the floor before that face of the door without going through ANY doorway (this one included) —
//                      flooded once per face, cell to cell, a step across a frame line inside its opening never taken. A room, or a yard: 'the room (or
//                      space) that face of the door is in'. A mark is ON it when its own cell is free and in the flood and the walk to that cell from
//                      the doorway is not a way round a wall (`roundM` + `roundK` × the straight line: a yard that wraps a building is one flood).
//   THE RULE           every mark a door order deals — the stack, its tucked form, a charge's stand-off, where the other pair steps back to — is on the
//                      face's floor. One that is not is dealt again, the first of these that has floor a body's room (`apart`) from every other mark, from
//                      Sam and from marks teammates hold on this door, out of every leaf's swing and off the opening's own lane:
//                        1 the next place along the wall on the OTHER jamb's side, past whoever stands there (Sam on a jamb has a man fall in behind him);
//                        2 the file turns the corner: behind the nearest man of his own file, straight off the door's wall;
//                        3 back from the door, to a hand of it (orders.ts rearPosts' places) — not the man who has the door to open;
//                        4 any floor of the face within `walkM` of walking, the nearest with a line to the doorway first;
//                        5 THE ROOM IS TOO SMALL: by a doorway of a room next to it that the team already holds (cleared.ts: one of ours has stood in it) —
//                          through one of the face's OTHER doors, the nearest by walking and one standing open first, within `nextM` of that doorway on its
//                          far face, never through a door locked against the team. That is the reading of his "an adjacent one on the other side of the door": the door BEHIND the stack, the way the team
//                          came — never the room about to be entered, never a room nobody has been in (open floor — a yard, a hall —
//                          only while one of the team stands on it), and outdoors only right by a door, never round the building;
//                        6 anywhere on the face's floor, off the opening's own lane, a body fits (`squeeze` apart).
//                        7 A PASSAGE NO WIDER THAN ITS DOOR (every cell before the door is in the opening's lane): down it in file, `laneBack` from the
//                          doorway, the nearest first — the build stacked men there, and an order is not refused where there is floor to stand on.
//                      A mark dealt again takes the facing, the wall shoulder and the file of the place it is dealt (the other wall's; his file-mate's;
//                      a stood-back man's); the man who has the door to open (`lead`) is only ever dealt floor of the face itself (1, 2, 4, 6, 7).
//                      A jamb man dealt again keeps `lead` only where no other mark of the set has it: the door has one opener, the man still on a jamb.
//                      With none of them the order has no room on that door, in the order's own words, as for any face without floor.
// STACKROOM.on off = none of it runs: every mark as the build before this file dealt it. On in the page; the frozen harness stand holds it off (TPS_STACKROOM=1
// turns it on for any headless tool), the shipped stand has it on; a recording carries it. Nothing here is state the game depends on: the floods are worked out
// again from the nav grid whenever its cells change (a wall blown, furniture gone), so there is nothing to save. Nothing is rolled: no die.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)

// A stack told to wait on a door that already STANDS OPEN was dealt the same jamb marks as on a shut one — and a jamb mark is a body's width from the opening:
// over every open door face of the squad levels 56 % of the places dealt were in plain view of the floor beyond (tools/qa/stackview-trace.ts), the jamb men
// nearly always, and two in five were across the opening from where the men stood. A shut leaf stops a round and hides a man; an open one does neither.
// So, for the plain 'stack up' only (the door tools file their own stacks and the entry is theirs): each place the floor beyond SEES is dealt again further
// along the door's own wall, the first place from that jamb the floor beyond does not see — on the face's own floor (the rule above), a body clear of every
// other mark, of Sam and of marks held on the door, never where another door swings, never behind glass a round reaches through, and never losing the line a
// place had to an open way at the stack's back (rearwatch.ts: the rear man's watch is dealt from his MARK). With `viewHand` a hand of the opening that was
// dealt more places than it has men to take them without crossing gives the ones nearest the frame to the other hand first, behind the file already there,
// so nobody is asked to cross the front of an open door to stand and wait. A place with no such floor stays where it was. Nothing else of the mark changes but its facing (down the wall at the doorway, as any wall mark);
// the door's one opener is the place nearest the frame. No pace, no sound, no gun: a silent team is exactly as quiet as before. Shut doors: not asked.
