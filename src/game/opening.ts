// THE NIGHT'S OPENING — nobody of the shift starts the night on top of the way in. A level's routes stand every man on his first waypoint, and on the office
// that put Kowalski at the corridor's west end, a stride from the one arch out of the lobby and four metres from the spawn, standing there for his first
// 2.5 s: a player who pressed W as the card closed was heard at 2.6 s, seen at 3.0 and dead at 4.1 (the missions goal's fault S1: 24 of 24 seeds). The rule:
// on a FRESH encounter that is the player's own (not a show's — a showcase starts the level's men from their marks at t = 0 and orders them from there), a
// staff man whose first waypoint is inside `clearM` of the spawn BY WALKING is put on down his own beat instead — the first point along his route, leg by
// leg, that is at least that far from the spawn — facing the way he walks, his next waypoint the leg's far end: the night found mid-patrol, his back to the
// door he has just walked past. Nothing else of him changes (state, senses, clocks, dice: no draw is made), and nobody further off is touched.
// `OPENING.on` false = every man on his first waypoint, the game exactly as it was (the harness stands up with it off — host/standup.ts, `TPS_OPENING=1`
// turns it on for any harness tool; the page ships it ON, `?fairstart=0` on the URL takes it off for the visit). A module table, read before `new Game`.
// Called from the Game constructor and guards.ts resetGuards (the still view behind the start card, a restart, a checkpoint load — whose own slices then
// place every man where the file says), and by the two roads that make a fresh encounter UNDER a show's flag and drop the flag after (director.ts exitShow,
// attract.ts stop: so the card's still view already has him there). Game.update also calls it once a frame, the net under those: a man is FRESH for
// FRESH_SECS after this module first met his Guard object, show or no show, so an encounter handed over live a frame later (director.ts c.handover — touring
// stays up, `handedOver` says it is the player's) is still placed, and a man met long ago is never moved however he happens to stand.
// NOT covered: a spot inside a prop or a shut leaf (the nav grid is the statics').
// QA: tools/qa/opening-check.ts.
