// THE LIGHTS GO OUT AND SOMEBODY GOES TO PUT THEM BACK ON (defenders answer the plan the team chose: the answer to the mains being cut).
//
// WHAT WAS THERE: lighting.ts setBlackout hands the walk to the breaker to the nearest calm man who can leave where he stands. A mission's defenders (the room
// fight's hostile units: a room clear, a rescue, the night breach) are every one of them held on a mark, so with workthings.ts's `posted` rule nobody is handed
// it and nobody says it: the team cuts the mains and the garrison stands in the dark for as long as the team cares to take.
//
// THE RULE, for a room fight's hostile defenders, once per blackout:
//   · WHO NOTICES: a living defender, his wits about him, with a mains-fed fixture that was burning in his plain view inside `seeM` (a clear line from his eye to
//     where it hangs) — or whose floor goes dark: the floor he stands on, watches (his aim and either edge of his look, out to `lookM`) or has about him
//     (`aboutM` every way) read `litAt` or over on the meter's scale by the place's own light at the trip and under `dropK` of that `darkAfter` seconds on (a
//     lamp over a glass roof, a fitting round a corner: what he loses is the lit floor, not the bulb). Nobody loses any: nothing is said and nobody goes — a
//     garrison in rooms with no light of the mains, or in daylight with no fitting in view, has nothing to miss.
//   · THE WORD COMES FIRST. `think` seconds after the trip (by the id of the first man to notice: no dice) one of them says on their net what they do, and
//     nobody moves for `beat` seconds after it. The net is what the team's strip shows (cues.ts), the walk files its boots for the team's ears (pressure.ts
//     boots), and the men who go burn their weapon lights for as long as the mains are down (guards.ts poseFlashlight: `powerOutLit`) — heard and seen
//     before it lands; what lands is the lights coming back on.
//   · WHO GOES: only men who are FREE (`kept` below — calm, holding a post the room fight gave them, nobody else's: no dig-in, squad's word, lane, press, buddy,
//     last stand, captor, script, Sam's arm). The breaker in a defender's own room: the man of that room nearest it, alone, and he never leaves the room.
//     Elsewhere: the `men` nearest it by the way they would walk, no further than `maxM`, A MAN LEFT IN EVERY ROOM THAT HAD ONE while that can be done; no
//     man to spare anywhere and `lone`: the nearest goes by himself and his room stands empty behind him (that is the price of the lights, and the team's
//     opening). A squad told to stay in its rooms (`mayLeave: false`: it answers no other squad's FIGHT) still sends for the lights with `stayers`.
//   · THE WALK is the room fight's own 'move' leg at the pace of a man going to look (his own senses under it: a man of the team seen close stops him to
//     fight, and he is the room fight's from there). The first man puts his hand to the lever (lighting.ts re-arms it under any man of their side who stands
//     at it: its own fumble, its own "breaker's back in"); the second stops a few paces short with a line to him and watches the way they came. The mains
//     back — by his hand, by the trip's own clock, by anybody — every man out walks back to the post he left and holds it as he held it.
//   · THE GARRISON ALREADY KNOWS (a man of them alert or searching, or with gunfire, a boot or a charge in his ears — or they are holding hostages: rescue.ts
//     has every one of them learn of the team by the dark itself): nobody walks out into a fight to mend a
//     fuse — "that's them — stay on your doors!", and THE WORD is out (below). The same the `parties`+1-th time the lights go in one fight, and after a
//     party that lost a man: a fault does not happen twice, and nobody is fed to it again.
//   · A BREAKER SHOT TO SCRAP: the man who gets there looks at it for `lookSecs`, says so, and the word is out; they go back.
//   · THE WORD (`powerOutWord`): their side holds the dark for the team's doing. darkfoe.ts takes it as the word a mate's lamp is — a man of theirs whose view
//     is dark lights his own — for as long as the mains stay down. Nothing else reads it.
//   · A MAN OF THE PARTY GOES DOWN OR IS TAKEN: nobody is sent again this fight. Nobody is told by magic either: a mate out with him who has the place he
//     fell in plain view (or who gets to his own place by the lever and finds nobody at it) says so ("he's down at the breaker — that's them!"), the word is out and he runs for his post; a fall nobody saw is only MISSED —
//     `overdue` seconds past the walk's own length with the mains still down and no word from the party, "nothing from the breaker — that's them!".
//   · THE FIRST MAN CANNOT STEP OFF when the beat is up (dazzled, taken, another rule's by then): the second goes for the lever in his place; neither can:
//     nobody goes, and the walk is not counted. A lever that will not take a hand in `leverSecs` is given up. The lights back and gone again inside a walk:
//     the party already out is the answer (a man on his way home turns back). The switch thrown off under a walk: the men out run back to their posts.
//   · FIGHT WHILE THEY ARE OUT (a man of them roused, or the walker's own ears count a shot, a boot or a charge): a man with his hand already at the lever
//     finishes; anybody else goes back to his post at a run and is the room fight's man there.
// Nothing here gives anybody better eyes, aim or health, and no man is added. What a defender acts on is a fixture he saw die, his side's net, and his own
// senses on the walk — never where the team is.
// DYNAMIC: the way to the breaker is asked of the walk grid as it stands when the word is given and again on every leg, so a wall blown open or a door
// wedged shut changes the way they come; a breaker no man can reach inside `maxM` sends nobody.
// No dice, no camera, no graphics setting, no wall clock. State per Game (powerOutSnapshot / powerOutRestore beside it, carried by savestate.ts; the timeline
// is the check's and the debugger's and is not kept). Type-only game imports but for functions used inside calls (src/game is one import cycle).
