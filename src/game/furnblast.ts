// FURNITURE UNDER A BLAST — "i'd expect the blast to upset all the furniture and have them break apart" (the maintainer, at the warehouse office's wall entry: a
// desk, a chair and two cabinets stood untouched a metre from the hole). A wall charge, a door charge or a frag grenade now reaches the furniture round it:
//
//   PUSHABLE furniture (props.ts: chairs, cartons, bins, plants) in reach is THROWN away from the blast and spun, harder the nearer, through the props' own solver
//   (applyImpulse: it slides, hits things, is heard like any shoved prop); one right beside the charge comes APART — the prop leaves the level, its parts fly as
//   rigid debris.
//   FIXED furniture (the level's statics: desks, cabinets, shelves, benches, lockers) close to the blast breaks: inside the SHATTER band every part is split and
//   thrown, further out (the APART band) wooden parts come away as planks and a metal cabinet goes over whole — by MATERIAL, through one data table (FURN_BREAK:
//   what a part splits into, how its pieces fly, what they are heard doing). What stood on it (monitor, papers, mugs, binders — the lane's own destructibles
//   through destr.dropItem, the rest as chunks) goes with it.
//
// REACH AND LINE OF BLAST DECIDE, NOTHING ELSE (no hit points): a thing is touched only when the blast point — or the MOUTH of a hole this very blast opened in a
// wall — has a clear line to it; a wall that held shields what is behind it. Other furniture is no shield (the pressure goes round a desk), chunky cover is.
// A STUN GRENADE DOES NONE OF THIS: only the three callers below reach this module; detonateStun's own canister never does.
//
// ONE MODEL: a broken static is hidden the way the lane hides everything (flags |= NoPrimary | NoShadow: the picture, every ray, sight, rounds, sound and feet
// drop it at query time), the nav cells under it re-baked, the sound routes and the smoke's obstacles told, and ONE row filed in the walls' change feed (kind
// 'cover', cause 'blast') so the AI reads it where it reads every other change. Cover pieces among the furniture (a desk's side panels) go through the wall
// engine's own road (WallBreak.raze). The pieces are the lane's rigid debris: they fly, land, are heard (a 'prop' event blamed on the thrower) and stay; like all
// debris they hurt nobody and stop nothing.
//
// BOUNDED: ≤ FURN.chunksPerBlast pieces a blast, a fixed count (nearest furniture first; a piece of furniture the count runs out BEFORE is left STANDING, one it
// runs out inside finishes as chips), the pool's own cap + evict / refuse rule under that (a refusal = a chip burst) — so WHAT breaks is the same on every
// quality tier and only chunk-or-chips follows the pool. DETERMINISTIC: its own counter through hash01, never Math.random, no wall clock. RESTORED on a restart
// (reset(): flags back, the props back in the list, nav re-baked). INERT with THE ONE SWITCH off, at chaos 0, under the tour or a showcase's own chaos, and with
// FURNBLAST.on false (`?nofurnblast` on the page, PT_FURN=0 under the playthrough harness): the build exactly as it was.
//
// CHECKPOINTS carry what broke (snapshot / check / restore at the foot of the class; savestate.ts files the slice `furn` beside the walls' and re-applies it after
// the restart, after the walls'): the statics a blast took and the props that came apart are gone again after a load, silently; the pieces on the floor are not
// filed (no debris is). Nothing broke = no slice, so such a file is byte for byte what it was; a file from before the slice loads as it did (the furniture whole).
//
// Callers: Destruction.blast (the wall charge and the frag — after the walls, so the hole is already open), combat.ts detonateStun for a BORROWED charge (the
// door charge; the wall charge's own borrowed bang lands in the same frame at the same place and is merged).
