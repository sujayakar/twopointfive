// The ROOM CLEAR (?roomclear[=seed], native --roomclear, __roomclear): the night team breach (nightbreach.ts) on a bigger floor — a small STRUCTURE of four connected
// rooms of the office's east wing, each held, to break down room by room with the same pair of teammates. A playtest scenario like the night breach it stands on,
// staged on the old office with what the demo already has.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE OWNS: the set-up and the score-keeping. The structure is LEVEL DATA (scene/scenarios.ts StructureData: Level.scenarios.roomClear — the office's is
// levels/office.scenarios.ts, exported here as STRUCTURE for its probes; a level with no breach plan gives the team's start too and has no F drill) — the rooms, the doors into each and what lies on the other side
// of them, how many men hold each room and the marks they may stand on (more marks than men: placeDefenders(seed, attempt) deals them, so a tally re-runs a
// placement by its seed and a restart can deal another); the per-room CLEARED state (RoomClearScenario.rooms); and the two ENDS — 'taken' (every room clear) and
// 'wiped' (Sam down). What it does NOT own: how either side fights and how the pair is ordered about. Both are the night breach's as it stands — the defenders are
// its held, pinned men of the fight AI with their guns on the door their mark watches, its blind fire included; the pair is its two operatives and F is still its
// two orders (stack up on the break room's west door, go) and nothing else, so nobody follows Sam on to the next room. This scenario IS the night breach while it is
// up: `game.nightBreach.active` is true, its cast lists hold everybody (`ops` the pair, `hostiles` all the defenders in placement order), and every gate keyed on
// it (no civilians, the response team and the cameras silent, no checkpoint, no attract mode) holds here with no line of its own. What tells the two apart is
// `game.roomClear.active` — THE flag to read for anything that should be on under ?roomclear and off under ?nightbreach.
//
// HOW IT HANGS ON THE NIGHT BREACH: one seam, nightbreach.ts NightBreachLayout. start() here hands the night breach's start() a layout; its staging then asks the
// layout for the defenders' marks instead of taking the breach plan's three (the drill is handed only the break room's men — the room behind ITS door), calls
// staged() once the cast stands, leaves the 'room clear' / 'point man down' calls to this file, and its stop() drops the layout. So every restart under it (Sam
// down and Enter, Shift+Enter, the pause card, restage()) stages the structure again through the night breach's own hook, and nothing else in the game knows this
// file exists but Game (the field, the tick) and the mission (mission.ts: the objective line and marker are this scenario's while it is up, and the stealth
// mission's stages — reach the server room, pull the drive, the fire exit — stand still: two of its three places are inside the structure).
//
// CLEARED: a room is clear while none of its own garrison is up AND no living defender stands inside its bounds on his own feet (so a man of another room who
// walked in — nobody does today: they are pinned — would hold it, and a room can be lost again; a man in Sam's arm holds nothing but still counts as up for his
// own room). Down is down however it came: shot, struck or choked. Nobody has to have walked in or
// looked: men dropped through the doorway from outside clear the room. That is the bookkeeping's truth, said on the HUD as it happens (ROOMCLEAR.announce) — with a
// fog of war over the floor that line tells the player something he may not have seen, which is the fog's to decide.
//
// With the flag off none of this runs: tick() returns on its first line and the layout seam is null. (src/game is one import cycle: the tables below are plain
// literals, nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
