// A GUN IS USED FOR WHAT IT IS FOR, AND THE DEFENDERS DRAW FROM THE SAME TABLE (GUNROLES). The maintainer, 10-18: "also should we model more firearms? and
// separate primary and secondary slots?" — the squad's cards got their guns (gunslots.ts); this is the two things that step left undone.
//
// THE DEFENDERS' DEAL (`deal`). Every defender of a room clear, a night breach or a rescue was spawned with the one short carbine. With the switch on a cast
// is dealt from weapons.ts WEAPONS as it is staged (gunDeal, called by nightbreach.ts and rescue.ts once the men stand on their marks), by the game's own die:
//   · ONE BELT-FED GUN (the PKM row) at most, to the man whose post looks down the longest line — if that line is a LANE (`beltLane` metres of clear floor from
//     his mark toward what he watches, in a cast of `beltMin` men or more) or the cast is a BIG one (`beltSquad` men). Neither: nobody has one.
//   · A PISTOL for the men who would carry one: one in `pistolShare`, a quarter of the cast at most (`pistolMax`), of the men whose post watches something
//     within `pistolNear` metres (a door at arm's length, a closet). Never the man on the long line.
//   · THE MAN WITH A HOSTAGE IN HIS HAND IS NOT DEALT (`captor` off): he keeps the gun his scenario gave him. He was dealt a pistol for a day (10-18), and a
//     set hostage room then cost the entering pair 7 of 12 men over six seeds where it had cost none (rescue-probes.ts rescue-set, the page's stand): with a
//     pistol up he had the men stacking on his door in his eye before the boot, and shot them there. What that man carries and does is the rescue's to say;
//     `captor` on is the pistol again, for whoever tunes that room with it.
//   · THE RIFLES: each other man an AKMS (`akms` of them, by the die) or the short carbine he always had.
// A die is drawn for every man whatever he is then given, so one man's gun never moves the next man's. Nobody is harder to put down: every row is `oneShot`.
//
// WHAT A GUN IS FOR (`use`), on both sides. Small differences in rules that already exist — no order, no word, no new thing to manage:
//   · ROOM GUNS (the MP7, the M1014) GO IN FIRST: on a stack their man takes the mark nearer the frame (orders.ts pair), he is the one picked to go first
//     (doortools.ts firstIn) and the men with long guns follow last (enter's turn).
//   · THE MK 12 MAN TAKES THE LONG SHOT AND HANGS BACK: the rear mark of the stack, last through the door, and of the openings the unasked cover deals
//     (cover.ts) the FAR one is his before it is another man's; in a room fight he fires single aimed rounds, not pairs.
//   · THE BELT-FED MAN HOLDS A LANE AND FIRES LONGER STRINGS: as the Mk 12 man on the stack and in the cover's deal (the rear man of a stack is the one who
//     keeps the way behind it: rearwatch.ts), his room-fight trigger is a string of the row's burst length where another man's is a pair — and a DEFENDER
//     with one keeps the post he was dealt: no rally, press, errand or dark-room move takes him off it (lanes.ts laneBars, and whoever asks of the post, ask gunKeepsPost).
//   · A MAN WITH ONLY A PISTOL DOES NOT TAKE THE FAR LANE: in the cover's deal the far opening is another man's before it is his (and a defender is only
//     dealt a pistol on a near post — the deal above).
// A man's gun here is his PRIMARY: the long gun on his sling while his sidearm is out, his own while the big slot's shotgun is in his hands.
//
// Off (the module, the frozen stand, `?nogunroles`): every defender carries the short carbine and no rule above reads a gun — the build before, by digest. With
// the switch ON and the squad's cards as issued (four issue carbines) every squad rule above answers as it did before too: nothing differs until a card names
// another gun. `GUNROLES_BREAK=1` (tools/qa/gunroles-check.ts): nobody is dealt anything and every man's gun reads as a plain rifle.
// Habits: the game's own die (simRandom) · nothing read off a camera or a graphics setting · no player named · NO STATE: a man's role is read off the gun he
// carries each time it is asked, so there is nothing to save or restore (the tallies below are for the check).
