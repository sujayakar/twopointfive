// LIGHTER KIT MOVES FASTER AND HIDES BETTER (the maintainer, 10-18: "we should also model a mobility / concealment score like door kickers 2 does -- there
// should be legitimate reasons to bring less kit"). Until this file more kit was simply better: a pouch filled cost nothing but the pouch. Now what a man
// carries gives him TWO SCORES, each 1 for a man with nothing on him and less for every thing on his card:
//   mobility      what his legs give him — the gun in his hands, every full pouch, the big thing on his back each take a little off
//   concealment   how easily he is noticed — a long gun is a long shape, a hammer on the back is a bigger one, and full pouches rattle
// and the scores change the run (the floor functions below, each a plain `×1` while the switch is off):
//   pace          the speed his legs are asked for is × loadPaceK, ONCE a leg: you (player.ts: walk, crouch-walk, the drag, the hold; your sprint keeps
//                 `sprint` of it) and a teammate (guards.ts teamLegs — followPath, stepAlongPath, a scripted man's strafe and settle; on top of the
//                 caps the squad's legs already have, which so scale with the man; never past `paceTop`: a teammate's walk is never a run — teampace.ts weighs a run its own way). A teammate's muzzle
//                 comes round and his legs pick pace up by the same factor (guards.ts teamTurn, teamLean): in a room a heavy man is the slower gun.
//                 The search that reckons how far you can have run (guards.ts floodFrom) and the sneak's price of a crossing (sneak.ts) read it too
//   seen          the notice a visible man builds in an eye is × loadSeenK (guards.ts sightGain and the hold's pairSightRate for you, sightGainOn for a
//                 teammate); the point-blank floor stands whole — a shape at a man's elbow is seen whatever it carries
//   heard         a footfall's level is × loadHeardK before the floor has its say (floor.ts tread: one number for the mixer, the ears and the meter) — and
//                 in the room fight's defenders' ears (pressure.ts teamBoots). Whether a step is a walk's or a run's is read off the pace he was ASKED
//                 for (loadGait): a light man made quicker is not thereby running. Your flat-out sprint is boots on a floor whatever you carry
// THE REFERENCE is each man's OWN CARD AS ISSUED (kit.ts kitIssuedShown: as the kit rules stand, and as a team of three or four is dealt the issue —
// KITDEAL): a card that scores what his issue scores is ×1 on all three,
// exactly — so the game as it was tuned is the game an issued squad plays, by run digest, and "as issued is the kit table off" still holds. Lighter than
// his issue pays, heavier costs; what a heavy card wins is the kit itself. (The price: two men issued differently are ×1 at different scores.)
//
// WHERE A SCORE COMES FROM: the card a staging put on the man, weighed THEN, beside his reference (kit.ts: kitPlayer writes yours on the Player through
// loadWear, `Player.kitLoad`, and it comes off with the card — kitShow; kitStage writes a teammate's through loadMan, the table `manLoad` below). What is
// on a man is his for the run: a rule switched on the page after he was staged, or a replay on another stand, does not re-weigh him. Nobody has a score
// whom a staging put no card on — a defender, a civilian, the plain night's Player as built, a showcase's cast — or whose kit the staging itself chose: a
// lesson's page, a mission that issues its own kit. THE WEIGHT IS THE POUCHES RULE'S (kit.ts SLOTS): with that rule off a card's rows are free counts
// that no table of weights was cut for, and nobody is weighed. Only the ROWS A CARD HAS weigh (kit.ts kitRows): a count kept on a card whose row is
// switched off is carried by nobody.
// GUNS: a gun weighs what its own row says (weapons.ts `weightKg` and `bulk` → gunLoad), and a card's guns are a LIST (gunsOf): the gun in his hands and
// the sidearm beside a long gun. With one gun row the row weighs the list; with a Primary and a Secondary row (gunslots.ts) the long gun is the
// Primary's and the sidearm the Secondary's. A new gun brings its own two numbers; nothing here names one.
//
// ONE SWITCH, `KITLOAD.on` — ON in the page (host/profile.ts pageSwitches; `?nokitload` = the build before), OFF here and on the frozen harness stand
// (`TPS_KITLOAD=1`; a FROZEN_HOLDS row, in the knob registry and a journal's tables: a recording from before the table replays with it off). Off = nobody's
// pace, notice or footfall is touched: the build as it was. `KITLOAD_BREAK=1` (the check's): the floor ignores the scores with the switch on.
// THE CARD'S FACE (ui/kitCard.ts) reads loadOf / loadShare whatever the switch says, and shows the two bars only while it is on.
//
// (src/game is one import cycle: the table below is plain literals; nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
