// EACH GUN IS FED ITS OWN WAY (gunlook.ts GUNLOOK: nothing here is read with that switch off, or of a row with no `own`). Until now every reload was a
// magazine change — the support hand to the well ahead of the grip, 'magOut', 'magIn', 'rack', an empty box on the floor — whatever the gun: a belt-fed gun
// swapped a rifle magazine, the tube guns had no hands at all. With the switch on a row's model says how it is fed (FEED below):
//   belt    the Mk 46: the feed cover up, the box off (an empty one falls), a full one out of his pouch and on, the belt laid in the tray, the cover slapped
//           shut, and the cocking handle run if nothing was chambered. Six sounds where three were, the hand at five stations.
//   shells  the M1014 and the big slot's pump gun: ONE AT A TIME — a trip of the support hand per shell from the side of the receiver to the loading port and a
//           'shellIn' for each, as many as the gun gains; the M1014 begun with nothing in it gets its first one straight into the ejection port and the bolt
//           dropped on it. Nothing falls. The pump gun's own rack is the pump: the old 'rack', slowed.
//   mag     the Mk 12, the MP7, the HK45 and the Glock 18: a magazine change as it was, heard as it was — with a magazine of the gun's own size in the hand
//           and on the floor, and the MP7's hand going to the foot of the pistol grip, where its magazine goes in.
// NEVER A PLAY NUMBER: a reload's length is the beat's it was begun on, the stages (out / in / rack) stand where the weapon has them, and the books — which
// rounds end up where — are weapons.ts Firearm's, untouched. Everything here is WHEN something is heard and WHERE a hand is inside that length. (So a tube gun
// takes its row's seconds whether one shell goes in or seven: the trips are spread over the feeding part of it. A length by the shell would be a play number.)
// …EXCEPT THE SHELLS KEY (gunlook.ts GUNLOOK.shells, the guns' own call and its numbers: weapons.ts `reload.shell`): a tube gun's reload is then a beat made
// for the shells that go in — a lead, so long a shell, a tail (shellPlan below) — and each shell is booked the moment it is heard (Firearm.feedShell), so a
// reload cut short keeps what was fed. Everything above is unchanged by it: the hand, the sounds and the drawer are worked out from the beat, whichever it is.
// NO STATE: what is shown is worked out each frame from the beat the animator's support hand is on (CharacterAnimator.feedClock) and what the Firearm said the
// reload puts in (Firearm.feedN / feedPort, written by startReload). The dice are touched once more than before by nobody: a thing that falls is the magazine
// that fell before, drawn as what it is.
// WHO GETS WHAT. You: all of it (player.ts reloadInHand). A teammate: the sounds on his beat wherever his reload has a clock (guards.ts tickReloadBeat,
// gunslots.ts taking his long gun up again), the hand's stations where the movement pass shows his change (game.ts deals his clock),
// always as a gun run dry — a full belt, a full tube, the first shell in the port; and his empty falls only where one fell before (tickReloadBeat).
