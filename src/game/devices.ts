// The level-design devices (STATUS G4, docs/level-format.md 'Devices'): wall CAMERAS that see Sam through the guards' own eye test and light meter and call the
// floor's radio, KEYPADS on doors whose code Sam has to learn before the pad takes it, LASER tripwires that call the radio when something breaks them. All three
// are authored in LevelData.devices (scene/levelData.ts DeviceData → Level.devices); everything they show — a camera's body, lens and LED, a pad's plate and
// LED, a beam's emitter, receiver and the beam itself — is drawn HERE from the record as dynamic boxes (nothing of them is in `boxes`), and cameras / emitters
// are light TARGETS (game.ts LightTarget kind 'device') so the pistol's OCP blinds them for its spell, a round kills them for the encounter, and the mains-fed
// ones die in a blackout and come back with the restrike — lighting.ts updateTargets works their `factor` out with everybody else's; this file only reads it.
//
// ONE MODEL. A camera's picture is the guards' eye (guards.ts eyeContact: cone, reach, the line to chest and head through statics and leaves, the smoke marched
// between lens and chest by the same probe segment a guard's eye gets) and its exposure is Sam's light meter (Player.visibility — dark to you is dark to it):
// lensGain below is sightGain's light × distance × crouch × smoke, without the human parts (motion acuity, an alarmed floor's keenness, a hunter's doubling —
// a lens does not startle; the man at the monitor gets the integrator's seconds instead). A code overheard is heard through the propagation the mixer and the
// guards' ears use (col.sound): out of earshot, nothing learned. Guards never trip their own beams and never mind the cameras.
//
// What a device DOES to the floor goes through what the floor already has: control's radio line (g.msg 'radio: CONTROL — …', the HUD's radio strip), the
// nearest calm man sent to look (a GuardTask 'device' — the rack errand's mechanism: it survives the suspicion decay, he walks there, looks round, talks himself
// out of it), the floor going up a step (guards.ts raiseEscalation cause 'device'), the debrief's chronicle. Live play only (g.aiEnabled, not the tour's
// quietUtility, tune.devices): under the tour they pan and glow and report nothing.
