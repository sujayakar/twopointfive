// DEFENDER SQUADS (the Door Kickers maps goal): on a level whose room clear structure declares `squads` (scene/scenarios.ts SquadData — who and where, never
// what they do when), the defenders are not one pool. Each squad holds its rooms until the team is on it; when the team is heard or met ELSEWHERE, each other
// squad makes ONE choice a player can read, said on their net before anybody moves:
//
//   BARRICADE  hold the rooms and get ready: the men stay, shut and wedge the squad's doors and take cover on them (digin.ts does the furniture — run for the
//              squad's men whatever the difficulty row says; only doors of the squad's `barricade` list are wedged). '<Squad>: holding — lock the doors!'
//   FLANK      a PAIR runs round to a door of the room under attack that the team is not known to be at — never across that room, never past where the team
//              was last seen or heard — and goes in from there (a fix out on open floor: by another way than the straight one); the rest of the squad
//              barricades. '<Squad>: two going round — keep them there!', their boots on the way (hearing events the team's ears take), '<Squad>: in
//              position — on them!'.
//   HELP       up to `helpMen` go straight at the fight on the fight AI's own hunt (the stock rally's hand-over: pursuit tactics, doors and all), a man kept
//              in every room the squad holds. '<Squad>: moving to <Ally>!'
//
// WHICH is the situation, never a die: `mayLeave: false` barricades; a squad with fewer than two men to spare past one a room barricades; a squad with men
// still out barricades. A squad in contact that still has two or more men up can hold the team where it is: the first squad to answer sends its pair ROUND;
// one down to its last man (or with no way round to it) gets men STRAIGHT; the second squad to answer does the other thing, a third locks down. A squad
// that has stopped answering: a strong squad (four at home) sends a pair round to where it was, anybody else locks down. The team heard on open floor with
// nobody in contact (surprise lost before the first door): nobody walks out at a noise he cannot place — every squad gets on its doors ('heard it — on the
// doors, call it when you see them!'), and STANDS TO: the next contact call on the net is answered after `readyBeat`, with no thinking beat (`openPair` =
// the first cut, a pair sent round to the noise: it walked onto the team's guns). So several squads hearing one fight neither all pile onto it nor all sit. What varies run to run is the men's own beats (a squad's thinking time is drawn like
// every reaction in the room fight), who is still up when the beat ends, and where the team is. A squad decides again when the fight moves to another squad.
//
// GOING ROUND WHERE A WAY ROUND EXISTS (SQUADS.goRound, on; off = everything above exactly, run for run — the squads-go-round goal: on the small-room maps a
// pair went round in 7, 19 and 11 of 144 scripted runs). Four things the rule above could not do in a room 5 m across whose two men are down before any
// squad has spoken: (1) the LAST-MAN gate is gone — a way round is asked for whatever the squad in contact has left, and men go straight only when there is
// none; (2) the team's door is the one the CONTACT CALL named (the men in the room know which door went in; ears through two walls do not), and a place the
// team was seen or heard closes a path, a spot or a door only with no wall between (roundCtx, wayRound2) — never a bare radius through the wall of the room
// the bang went off in; the search keeps out of every line of fire it knows of, a doorway's own lane included, and every spot outside a door is tried;
// (3) a man sent round WALKS THE WAY HE WAS GIVEN, mark by mark — handed the spot alone he ran to it by the shortest path, which is the one past the team's
// door; (4) a room the team already HAS (the squad that held it has one man up in it, or none) is not gone into by two men through its other door: the
// pair HOLDS that door from outside — '<Squad>: two going round — cut them off!', '<Squad>: in position — we have the door!' — from beside it, or from
// short of the open ground in front of it where the way there has to cross that; they are their squad's men there (digin.ts leaves them be) until the room
// fight moves them, their own rooms are hit, or `holdSecs` of quiet. The timeline says what became of each man sent ('met', 'lost').
//
// WHAT A SQUAD KNOWS is what its men see and hear, and what the net says (one model for the picture and the AI): it is in CONTACT when a man of it at home
// has eyes on the team, hears a loud thing inside the squad's own rooms (a boot on its door, a charge, a round), or drops there with a mate at home to know
// it; its call ('<Squad>: contact — <room>!') needs a man able to make it, and is what the other squads act on after `netLag`. Where the team IS, for a way
// round, is where defenders last saw or heard it — never its true position.
//
// A hit squad's men in its OTHER rooms come to the room under attack after their own beat. A man who gives ground (roomfight.ts breakOff) goes to the squad's
// `rally` point when it is in a room of the squad's the team is not known to be in; a `mayLeave: false` squad's men never leave its rooms (but, stayask.ts: on a floor
// where EVERY squad stays, one man of a squad walks to the posts of a squad that has gone silent on the net).
//
// WHAT THIS FILE OWNS: who of a squad may leave his room, and when. So on a squads level the stock rally (roomfight.ts) and the harder defenders' press
// (pressure.ts consider) do not take a squad's man — one clause each — and digin.ts waits for the squad's word before a man starts on his door. Everything
// else of both files runs as it does (the fall-backs, the wedge, the cover, the cues). No squads block, or SQUADS.on false: nothing here runs, no die is
// drawn, and every seam returns on its first line — the game as it was, run for run.
//
// NOT BUILT: `arrive` squads (they validate and load; nobody comes — sixteen skinned characters are all on the floor with eleven defenders, and taking
// bodies away mid-run is the room clear's bookkeeping to change first).

   *      once more at a later roll call (not at all if only one squad is left to ask). Not in contact: nobody has seen anything. A body of that squad
   *      in a looker's eye, or the team in it, is his to call like any man's (the call beat: it can be cut off); nothing at the posts: '<Squad>: no
   *      sign of Dock — back on our doors!' and nobody asks after that squad again.
   *  (d) THE LAST MAN DOES NOT WALK OFF ALONE: a man who is the last of his squad at home as far as he knows (every other is out, known down, or was
   *      asked for and did not answer), whose ask by name got no answer, says so on the net ('<Dock>: nothing from Tango 10 — I'm alone here, somebody
   *      look!') and the men of (c) go to that post in his place ('copy, Dock — two moving to you!', a breath later; a second man missing while they
   *      are on their way: 'nothing from Tango 9 either — his post too!'). No squad able to send: he says that ('… I'm alone here, going myself!'),
   *      the squads go wary, and he goes.
   *  (e) A MAN THE NET SENT WHO KEYS UP AND IS CUT OFF IS THE ALARM (`netCutAlarm`, read only with the net's ask on): he was sent to find out why a
   *      squad is silent, his squad heard him start to say what he had found, and then nothing. A man of it at home calls it: '<Squad>: Tango 5 cut
   *      off at Dock — contact, Dock!'. The place on the net is the post the squad sent him to — its own knowledge, not where the team is. Off: his
   *      broken call is one more man to ask for by name, as any cut-off caller's is.
   *  Nobody is told where the team is, by any of it: the places are the squads' own posts. A squad that has put a contact call on the net is not asked
   *  after (everybody knows what became of it: the squads' own words handle it, as they did). */
