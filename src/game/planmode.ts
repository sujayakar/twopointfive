// PLAN MODE — a PROTOTYPE beside the orders ring (cmdring.ts `plan`; the design: rebuild/commanding/command-mode.md). OFF in the module and on both
// stands; the page raises it when asked for beside the ring (`?cmd&cmdplan`). The maintainer's words for it: an RTS's way with a squad, "for advanced
// players that requires explicitly leaving".
//
//   · SHIFT + THE RING'S KEY TOGGLES IT (where that key is free: with a menu, a Space list, a verb or the launcher's arc to back out of, it backs out).
//     While it is up the mouse is the squad's, not Sam's — he does not fire or aim — and Shift, its modifier, is not his sprint.
//   · SAM STANDS WHERE HE IS AND THE VIEW IS THE HAND'S (the maintainer, 10-20: "your player character is stuck, wasd moves the camera around … it should
//     feel like you're switching into an RTS mode temporarily"): the walk keys move the view's own point (`look`, which the follow camera is given in
//     place of him — Game.followPos; no further than where he is still on the screen, CMDRING.planNear, or as first built `planPanReachM` from him and the men), he goes on facing what he faced when the mode went up
//     (`aim`), and the view comes back to him when the mode is put down. Every other key is still his.
//     This, and the right button's hold below, is `CMDRING.planRts` (raised by the page with the mode; `?nocmdrts`, and a recording from before the
//     key, have the mode as it was first built: he walks with it up, the view is on him, a right click orders as the button goes down).
//   · THE LEFT BUTTON PICKS MEN: a click on a man (his body, or the circle at his feet) is him alone; with Shift it adds him or takes him out; a drag
//     boxes the men in it (with Shift: adds them); a click on nothing is everyone again. Everyone, a whole pair and one man are the who key's own
//     choices and are kept as that (`SquadOrders.who`); any other set is `pick`, which `recipients()` reads ahead of `who` until the who key is pressed.
//   · THE RIGHT BUTTON ORDERS, BY STARCRAFT'S RULES. A plain right click is the quick key's order on what the cursor is on — what the squad would do
//     there (autopilot.ts, asked whether or not the quick key's own switch is on) — for the picked men, and REPLACES whatever chain they were on. Shift +
//     right click ADDS that stop to the end of the chain each of them is on (men picked out of a bigger chain part from it and keep its stops; a man
//     on no chain starts one). An order goes NOW: the men walk as the chain is laid. The click is read when the button comes UP, because …
//   · … THE RIGHT BUTTON KEPT DOWN (`planHoldSecs`) IS THE RING ("long right click opens the radial menu"): the order menu up as a ring at the cursor for
//     the picked men (orders.ts ringByButton), and the button let go gives the lit wedge — its first wedge is the click's own order, chain and all; any
//     other is an order by hand. With Shift down the button never opens it: a stop added to a chain is the first wedge's (a limit of the prototype).
//   · A CHAIN PAUSES FOR THE WORD'S KEY (doortools.ts blowKey) at a door's threshold — stacked, the entry not yet given — and, when something is chained
//     after it, once that room is taken; a thing a man was sent to work is the same kind of stop. A room in the middle of a chain is so two presses: go
//     in, then move on. A stop on the floor is not a pause: they walk on. The key speaks to the chains of whoever is picked (everyone by default).
//   · AN EARLY PRESS COUNTS FOR THE NEXT PAUSE (`spent`): the key's mark comes off the plan there, and with the mode down the plan is shown for a
//     moment so it is seen to go. Only a press NOBODY ELSE TOOK is kept (planLate, behind the key's other readers): a charge to blow, men waiting
//     on the word and a plan laid for it all come first.
//   · AN ORDER GIVEN ANY OTHER WAY (the menu, the ring, the quick key) takes its men off their chains — except the way in given on the door a chain is
//     stacked on, which IS that chain's word. A right click that is refused changes nothing.
//
// WHAT IS WHOSE. A step is a place written down as planlay.ts writes one (a door by its place on the level's list, a spot, a man) and is GIVEN through
// `SquadOrders.quickFor` when its turn comes: every refusal, reason and entry choice is the order book's and the autopilot's. Nothing here moves a man.
//
// PER SEAT: the state lives with the order book (`SquadOrders.plan`); whoever's input that book reads picks and orders. STATE: PlanState, plain data —
// `planSnapshot` / `planRestore` are its pair (savestate.ts files it with the switch on); a drag in hand is not filed.
