// sampled twice a second; and the handful of counters the stealth score is made of that the mission's own tallies (game.ts MissionStats) do not already keep.
// Written where the thing already happens — one-line hooks in guards.ts / combat.ts / lighting.ts / player.ts / game.ts / mission.ts, listed on each helper below —
// through the same gate as the mission's tallies (mission.ts missionLive: live play only — nothing the showcase tour, its puppet or the attract loop does is the
// player's run, and a run that is over stops writing), O(1) per entry, capped, no allocation per frame beyond the half-second path sample.
// Read by the debrief card (ui/debrief.ts: the score, the rating word, the badges, the stats grid, the scrollable timeline, the floor map with the path and the
// pins) and by the QA probes (tools/qa/debrief-probes.ts). Lives on Game.chronicle; restartEncounter() replaces it; the end card and the down card read it as it
// stood when the run ended, and it survives 'Keep playing' (nothing more is written: the mission is done).
