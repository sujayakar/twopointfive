// SPOTTED — what Sam's SILENT partner does once a defender is suspicious, and once the pair is caught.
//
// The play note: "we also haven't tried anything with two person stealth yet, we should try this and polish"; and on the squad's goggles, a teammate follows
// Sam's lead "or staying dark while not compromised". silent.ts already gives the calm half (he walks, stays dark, holds his fire on a man who has not
// noticed). This is the half after that — the three things a silent teammate does that he did not, each with its switch, ALL behind SPOTTED.on (off = every
// function here returns on its first line and the game is the game):
//
//   SUSPICIOUS  a defender in reach has said 'huh?' (the game's own state 'suspicious': awareness over 0.3, nobody shot at yet).
//     hold      no round at a man who is only suspicious — whatever his awareness. As it was, the hold ended at awareness 0.5, well short of the 0.85 at
//               which the man himself goes alert: the team's rifle (modelled loud, suppressor or no — weapons.ts) answered a man who had heard a lock click.
//               The gun still comes onto him and stays there ('eyes on. holding.'), so the round goes the frame he goes alert. A quiet gun is not held
//               (silent.ts quietGun: the loadout's Quiet set), a floor loud has already reached holds nobody, and a hostage's last warning holds nothing.
//     low       he gets down on a knee (the eye's own crouch term: three quarters of the rate) …
//     freeze    … and stands still where he is while the man has a line to him or is near enough to hear a boot (a still shape in the half-dark fills
//               the meter at a third of a walking one's rate — guards.ts motionCore), unless Sam has walked on past `leashM`: then he follows, low.
//     slip      LIT and in the man's line (the line asked of the walls and furniture only: a shut leaf between them is about to be eased open), he takes the
//               nearest spot a couple of strides off that is out of the line — or, failing one, in the dark — and gets low there. Not at once: a moving
//               shape is what draws an eye, so he holds still for `slipWait` after the man turned, and only then moves.
//     brace     (ITS KNOB SHIPS OFF: with the sneaking follower's own rules on, the partner is already low and out of a door's line before the man drops.)
//               BEFORE the noise: a man has just been dropped (Sam's quiet round, his hands — the partner is at his shoulder and sees it). The body's weapon
//               is on the floor a beat later and every mate in earshot turns to it; for `braceSecs` each defender within `braceM` of that body who is not
//               yet roused is his business as if he had already turned — low and STILL where he is, never a step — so he is not the shape that man's eyes land on.
//     close     AT ARM'S LENGTH: a roused man who has turned to HIM inside `takeM`, nothing between them, is taken by hand — the takedown any body in this
//               game can be given (out cold, quiet), `takeSecs` with his hands on the man inside `takeReach`. Nothing shields him while he closes: a man
//               already ALERT is only gone for from contact distance (further out it is the gun, below), and never with a quiet gun in his hands.
//   CAUGHT      a defender is ALERT with his eyes on Sam or on a teammate (a real sighting inside `freshSecs`), or loud has reached this man since the order.
//     keen      he shoots on a sighting, as any roused man does (roomfight.ts: the calm floor's 'shape made out over time' is waived — nothing else is:
//               the same sight test, the same reaction beat, the same aim-settle law, the same one round a man).
//     gun       his gun goes onto the man who has them (and, suspicious, onto the man whose line he is in: it is there the frame that man goes alert) —
//               as it was he kept covering the opening cover.ts dealt him, his back to the fight.
//     step      following, with no SHOT on the man who has them (a wall between, a desk he sees over and cannot shoot over, or Sam standing in his
//               line — the file as it walks: the room fight keeps a gun down while Sam is in its lane), he takes the nearest spot
//               a couple of strides off that HAS one, off Sam's own line of fire, and fights from it — instead of standing in file behind Sam.
//     unaware   (the fire discipline that goes with a loud rifle; `holdUnaware`) before anything loud has happened, an alert or searching man who has NOT
//               got eyes on either of them, is not turned their way and is not close is left to Sam's quiet gun: the rifle stays on him and goes the moment
//               he turns, sees, or closes.
//   THE CUES    each change is SAID, once, by the man himself over the net (he is silent: guards.ts say hushes it to the radio strip), and the squad line's
//               word on the HUD says it while it lasts: 'SILENT · low', 'SILENT · contact'. Back to calm he says so too.
//
// NEVER a buff: nobody takes more to drop, nobody's aim is touched, no defender's senses are changed. He is harder to see only by what any man can do — be
// still, get low, get out of the line or out of the light — and quicker to shoot only by not waiting to make a shape out once the shape is shooting.
//
// WHAT HE KNOWS: a defender's state within `waryM` of him (the man says 'huh?' aloud and squares up to the noise — that is the cue the player has too), and,
// for 'caught', the alert the man shouts ('CONTACT!'). He does not read awareness numbers, and a man in a far room is nothing to him.
//
// Scope: the squad under Sam's orders while it is SILENT (silent.ts silentMan). A loud squad, a show, the tour, a man a drill owns: untouched. Feet are only
// ever changed for a man who is FOLLOWING (fall in); a man posted by an order (hold, cover, move there, a stack) keeps his feet and only gets low.
// State is per Guard in a WeakMap: nothing on the Game, nothing in the digest, nothing in a checkpoint.
// Probes: tools/qa/spotted-probes.ts. Tallies: tools/qa/pair-sneak.ts with SPOTTED=1 in the environment.
