// RAILS: a tutorial mission's frame over a lesson (lesson.ts). The maintainer, of a better tutorial: "we want progressive disclosure … and also really
// want them to be on rails and hard to get lost", "has to be very linear and obvious what to do … also disable all features that player isn't supposed to
// do", and of its checkpoints: "we should also very intentionally curate checkpoints".
//
// A level's `scenarios.lesson` block carries a `rails` record (scene/scenarios.ts RailsData) and its steps a few more keys; a level without the record is
// the lesson it always was, and every entry point here returns on its first line. With the record, and the switch on:
//   · LOCKED ACTIONS. What the player can do is a set of ACTIONS (ACTS below: `move`, `order`, `word`, `fire` …): `rails.allow` from the first step, plus
//     each step's own `allow` from the moment it comes up, less its `deny`. A key, a button or the wheel of an action not in the set is taken out of the
//     tick's input before anything reads it (Game.step, right after the record is loaded: the record itself, the tape and a replay keep what was pressed;
//     the gate is a function of the game's state, so a replay drops what the run dropped). The page's own keys (pause, the back key, Enter) are never locked.
//     The game asks for fixed key CODES and a rebind happens at the keyboard (host/keymap.ts), so the lock follows whatever key a row is on.
//   · THE SET IS DERIVED, never kept: the step that is up says it all, so a checkpoint put back or a snapshot holds nothing of it.
//   · A CUE. A step's `cue` is sent to the level's script (director.ts, its play program 'tutorial') as the signal `lesson:<cue>` the tick the step
//     comes up; the lesson test `{ is: 'cue', name }` is true once the program has raised `done:<name>`. The program is started here when the run
//     starts, after a restart, and after a checkpoint is put back (with that checkpoint's own cue sent again: a beat starts clean from its cue).
//     Every order the player gives reaches the program too, as the signal `order:<id>`.
//   · AUTHORED CHECKPOINTS. A step's `checkpoint` asks for one save the tick it comes up (savestate.ts Checkpoints.keep: kept in memory, whatever is on
//     the floor), and on a rails level those are the only saves: the every-step request and the floor's own triggers stand down.
//   · NOBODY IS LOST. `rails.respawn` seconds: a teammate who would have gone down is on a knee for that long and then up again (railsSpare, asked by
//     combat.ts killGuard) — by behaviour, no hit points.
//   · FOG BY THE STEP. `rails.fog` / a step's `fog`: the fog of war as the newest step that says so has it.
//   · THE SKY SEAT (`rails.sky`): nobody on the floor is the player. He is parked out of the picture and out of every sense, the view rides the squad
//     and the walk keys (action `pan`) shift it about them; the seat's own rows on the HUD are the page's to hide (Rails.skyOn).
//   · THE HOLD IS ITS OWN LINE (a step's `noTap`, `menuLine`): while a step teaches the command key held, a tap of it gives no order and a few words come up
//     under the line; with the ring up the line is what to press in it. A step's `eye` is one more lookout for the fog while it is up (the squad's own charge
//     on a wall, which its men stand with their backs to); a step's `onWay` hands the view back to the squad once its order is given.
// THE PROMPT: `prompt()` is the one line the page draws big (ui/overlay.ts) in place of the small objective row.
// The switch `RAILS.on`: ON in the page (`?rails=0` = a rails level is its mission alone: no lesson, nothing locked, no cues — lesson.ts `data`), OFF here and
// on the frozen stand (`TPS_RAILS=1`). No shipped level but the tutorial group's carries the record, so no other run moves either way.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
