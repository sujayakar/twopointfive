// Tracer rounds (rifles, docs/internal/sc20k-design.md §3.3 / §11.5 — lane R6). A round is hitscan and has landed by the time anyone sees anything; the tracer is
// the PICTURE of it: a streak that travels muzzle → impact over a few frames (effects.ts tracerFx.speed), drawn the way a spark is drawn (sparks.ts) — one thin
// emissive box from where the head was a shutter-time ago to where it is now, raster + bloom only, flagged NoShadow so no ray of any kind (light, sight, bullet,
// cursor, cascade) ever meets a centimetre-wide box hanging in a doorway — plus what a spark does not have: a small warm TRANSIENT light riding the head, so the
// wall it passes, the floor under it and the haze it crosses light up for the frames it is there and keep nothing of it afterwards (LightSet's ttl lights carry
// the transient bit: out of every accumulated signal, exactly like a muzzle flash). Where the round stopped in something solid the head ends in an ember (a few
// sparks back off the surface and a 60 ms glow); in a man, or out into the night past 60 m, it just ends. No ricochet (later, maybe: reflect off `col.raycast`'s
// normal for shallow hits). Which rounds trace is the row's TracerSpec read off the gun's own counters (isTracerRound below); pistols and the FN2000 carry none.
// Everything is pooled (tracerFx.maxLive streaks, each owning its box and its light object; the oldest is evicted), nothing is allocated per frame, and with no
// streak alive update() is a compare and a return. Game.tune.tracers off = fireWeapon never calls in here at all.
