// BRISK THROUGH AN OPEN DOOR'S LINE ON THE WALK UP (STACKLINE.on — ships on; `?nostackline` for a visit, TPS_STACKLINE in the harness's environment).
// A man ordered to stack on a door walks briskly (ORDERS.brisk) until he is `briskIn` from his mark and takes the last steps slowly (ORDERS.onto). When the
// door STANDS OPEN those slow steps are taken in what the room beyond can see — and shoot — through it, and the man whose mark is past the opening crosses
// its whole front at them. Traced on the warehouse with four (seed 9, shipped stand): the squad has taken the front office; the door from it to the manager's
// office was pulled open by a defender eleven seconds before; 'stack up' on it finds the four standing in what the manager's office sees through that
// opening (that small room is all line: 6 to 10 m² of their floor can see any spot of it); Blue Two's mark is at the far jamb, and one second and 0.9 m into
// his walk he is shot through the opening by a man who has just come into the manager's office by its other door.
//
//   THE RULE   a man walking to a mark of the order 'stack' on a door that stands open, on his mark's face of it and with a clear line at chest height to
//              the mouth of the opening, does not drop to the slow last steps: he keeps the orders' own brisk walk (ORDERS.brisk, handed in by the
//              caller — nobody runs) until he is on his mark. That is all.
//   NOT        a shut door (a leaf stops a round: the walk up to it is as it was) · a team in the silent posture (silent.ts: it keeps its own pace) · any
//              mark that carries a pace of its own (the threshold's slice, the entry) · a man already on his mark · the door tools' OWN walk-ups (a tool
//              given straight on a door files the men under the tool's order, not 'stack': those marks keep their slow last steps — not covered, and
//              not measured).
//   WHAT IT IS NOT: a way round. One was built first — the walk priced by the floor beyond the door that can see each step — and measured on every door face
//              of every squad level: it found a better way for one walk in eight, took 3 % off the line for 1.4 % more walking, and left one stack that
//              no longer formed (the way round a standing leaf is through it). The room in front of an open door is nearly all line; there is no way round
//              to find. It is not in the code. The pace alone takes 14 to 16 % off the line and forms the stack a third of a second sooner.
// Nothing here moves a mark (stackroom.ts, orders.ts stackPosts — a mark beside an open door is itself in its line, and that is theirs), deals a watch
// (cover.ts, rearwatch.ts), finds a way (orders.ts route) or touches the entry (doortools.ts). No state: four sight lines a frame for a man on his last
// steps, asked of the level's solids and the leaves as they stand — nothing to save, no dice, nothing read off a camera or a graphics setting.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
