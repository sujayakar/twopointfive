// A LONE DEFENDER RADIOS FOR A BUDDY (the maintainer, 10-07: "and then if someone is alone in a room, they could radio for a buddy"). Behind `BUDDY.on`
// (shipped OFF — see the measured note below; off: nothing here runs, no die is drawn, and the room fight is roomfight.ts run for run as it was — its seams are `buddyTick` at the tail of tick(),
// `buddyStop` in stop() and one clause in rally()).
//
//   THE CALL. A scenario defender holding a room with nobody of his side left in it — his room mates down, or gone to a fight elsewhere (`staged`: also a man
//     who was posted alone, once the floor has gone loud in his own ears) — and nobody of the team in his sight these `quiet` seconds, says so on their net
//     after his own beat — and not while his own room is being hit (`calm`): 'I'm on my own in here — somebody get to me!'. That is `g.say(…, radio)`, the line every other defender call is ('<callsign>
//     (radio): …' in the log): the player hears of a room held by one man.
//   THE ANSWER. The nearest FREE colleague by the way a man walks answers after a beat of his own ('on my way to you — hold on!') and comes: a man holding a
//     post with nobody in his sight, whom nobody else has (a squad about to give its word, a squad whose men stay in its rooms, the harder defenders' press,
//     the rescue's men with the hostages), inside `maxM` of path, on a way that does not pass where the team was last seen or heard (`clearM`). Who is free is
//     situation, not dice: a man alone himself may come (`loners`: the two pair up in the caller's room, and — `emptyRoom`, shipped on — so may a squad's last man in one of its
//     rooms or a man set on a door he has wedged: his room is left empty behind him), one of a room that keeps two men holding it behind him may come, one of a PAIR stays (`fromPair` off: he would
//     leave his own mate calling). Nobody free: the call stands `again` seconds and the first man to come free answers it.
//   THE WALK is pressure.ts's leg (`run`: a script with his own senses under it — roomfight.ts tickMove: an enemy seen close stops him to fight), his boots
//     filed for the team's ears (`boots`), run again in legs when the room fight's ten-second move plants him short. The caller down or gone before he is
//     there: 'he's not answering — going back!', and back to the post he left.
//   MEANWHILE the caller waits for him: he does not walk off to a fight next door by himself (roomfight.ts rally asks `buddyOwns`), nor does the pair for
//     `again` seconds after it is made. That is the stock rally only: his squad's word (enemysquads.ts) or a press (pressure.ts) still takes him, and the
//     man coming finds him where he stops, if there is still a way that is not past the team.
//   THERE he is the room fight's holder of that room ('with you — two on this room!'), told what the caller knows of its doors (the caller's evidence is his),
//     put on a door the caller is not watching.
//
// What the counts mean (`buddyStats`, tools/qa/playthrough.ts files them per run): `calls` = the line said · `answered` = a colleague set off · `arrived` =
// he planted in the caller's room with the caller up · `metOnWay` = the team stopped him first · `turnedBack` = the caller was down or gone before he got
// there · `diedOnWay` · `noOne` = a call nobody could answer inside `again` · `secs` / `metres` = call to arrival, and the way walked, summed over arrivals.
