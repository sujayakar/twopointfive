// IR LASERS (the maintainer, 10-06: "and then we could also model IR lasers (assuming enemies don't have night vision)" — "ready or not is a good base case
// here"). The squad's aiming laser is ONE device with two bands, and which band it is in follows its carrier's goggles, nowhere else — no key, no order:
//
//   A TEAMMATE (a man who wears the goggles: nvg.ts nvgWorn — an operative unit of a scenario, never a showcase's cast). Goggles DOWN: the laser is infrared,
//     and it is ON whenever his gun is at his shoulder (IR.carry: he cannot use his sights through the tube — the laser is how a goggled man aims, so it
//     lies along every sector he covers; thumb off the switch with the muzzle lowered for a colleague in the line, as ever, and for any frame the bore
//     lies on Sam or a teammate: paintsOwn). Goggles UP (a lit place, or behind
//     his own white light — nvg.ts decides, every frame): he drops the infrared, and what he shows is what the build before this file showed — the red line,
//     on when it was on before. WHAT THAT WAS, measured: the red laser's switch is the guard AI's hunting
//     states (alert / search), and the room fight never puts a scenario's teammate in either — so before this file a teammate in a scenario showed no laser at
//     all, and with his goggles up he still shows none. The showcases' operatives (no goggles) are untouched.
//   SAM (IR.sam): the same device on the gun in his hands while a scenario's team is on the floor — infrared with his goggles down and the gun UP (the rifle
//     whenever it is in his hands; the pistol while it is pointed — just fired, or behind its light — not at the relaxed carry, where the bore is not his aim),
//     nothing with them up (he showed no laser before this file and shows none now: invisible to them and no use to him bare-eyed).
//   AN ENEMY has no night vision and no infrared anything: his laser, where the sandbox switch gives him one (combat.ts LASER.enemy), is the red one.
//
// WHO SEES AN INFRARED LASER: a viewer whose eyes are behind a tube. In this game the only picture is the player's, so an IR laser's line and dot are handed to
// the renderer exactly while that picture IS the tube's (irViewer: Player.nvAmount past the half-way at which post.wgsl swaps the bare-eyed picture for the
// intensifier's — not the N key's own frame: the goggles take a moment to come down and nothing infrared may show in a bare-eyed frame). Goggles up: no box.
// The rule sits in ONE place, combat.ts beamBoxes, which makes no infrared box otherwise whoever asks. (A band bit on the box that the post pass honours would
// hold it in the shader itself; that is renderer work on both engines, not done here.)
//
// WHO IT REACHES OTHERWISE: nobody, by construction, and that is the whole of how the one-model rule is held here. A weapon laser — red or infrared — was
// only ever a picture: combat.ts beamBoxes makes emissive boxes flagged NoShadow, which the trace grid never holds (scene/boxes.ts), so no shadow, gather,
// cascade or probe ray meets one, and it is not a light: nothing is added to the light list the picture and the light meter sum. An enemy's eye (guards.ts
// sightGain off the GPU meter), a camera's lens (devices.ts lensGain) and every CPU estimate read lights and occluders, never these boxes. So an IR laser
// cannot raise what an enemy or a camera reads — and neither can a red one: ENEMIES DO NOT NOTICE A TEAMMATE'S VISIBLE LASER TODAY either (said on the page as
// an open call, not built here). Teammates 'aim with it' in the only sense the simulation has: it lies along the bore their rounds leave by, in the frames they
// are up for; nobody's aim, sight or decision changes with the band or the switch.
// tools/qa/irlaser-probes.ts holds all of it (probes.ts irlaser).
//
// IR.on false = the lasers of the build before this file, box for box: every laser 'visible', Sam with none.
// IR.teamOff (ON in the page, ?teamlasers puts the lines back; off here and on the frozen stand): no man on the player's side shows a laser line, of either
// band, in any state; Sam's own is untouched. The band and every rule above still hold underneath it — the switch only keeps the boxes from being made.
// NOT here: the IR ILLUMINATOR — a LIGHT only a tube sees by, on the same goggles. That one is irlight.ts (it retired nvg.ts's 'too dark for the tube, so white
// light' for a man who carries one).
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
