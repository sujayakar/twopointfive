// THE REAR MAN COVERS THE DOOR BEHIND (REARWATCH.on — ships on; `?norearwatch` for a visit, TPS_REARWATCH in the harness's environment).
// A stack on a door stood with every gun on that door from the moment it was let go, and the rear man's spare eyes before that were whatever the unasked
// cover (cover.ts) happened to deal him that quarter second: a door standing open at the stack's back dropped out of the deal whenever a mate was near its
// frame or in his lane, and from the boot, the can or the shove on nobody watched it at all. Traced on the warehouse with four (seed 9, the older stand): the
// squad stacked on one door of a small office with the office's other door open behind it, 'open and clear' two seconds later, and a man was shot through
// the door behind while the four of them looked at the one in front.
//
//   THE WAY BEHIND  a DOOR other than the one being worked, standing `ajar` open or off its hinges, inside REARWATCH.reach of the nearest of the stack's marks, with a face on
//                   the floor the stack stands on (stackroom.ts's floor of that face of the door). Doors onto floor the team has not been on (cleared.ts; open
//                   ground is never 'been on') come first, then the nearest. One somebody else already holds — a posted man of another order, another man's
//                   unasked cover, the stack's own lane man (doorway.ts) — is not counted. (A gap with no leaf, the slot between two shelves, a passage's
//                   mouth: those stay the unasked cover's to deal, as before — the nav grid's gaps are mostly furniture, not ways onto the floor.)
//   THE REAR MAN    of the men whose eyes the order leaves spare (orders.ts spareRear: the furthest from the frame; the last two of four), the one with a line to
//                   that way from his MARK (into the doorway, to its open leaf's edge, or to the floor just before it: rearSees). He is PINNED to it: cover.ts deals it to him ahead of everything else and past the filters that let it drop
//                   (a mate by its frame, a mate brushing his lane, the walk's own narrower list). A fight or a warm contact still takes him, as it takes any
//                   man off any opening (cover.ts free()). With no way behind, or no line to one from any rear mark, nothing is pinned: the deal as it was.
//   THROUGH THE ENTRY  (REARWATCH.through; 'open and clear', 'bang and clear', the charge; three men or more) he keeps it through the boot, the can and the
//                   shove, and FOLLOWS LAST: doortools.ts puts him at the end of the turn, and he goes on that turn — the entry is not a gun short and not
//                   a second slower for him. The first guns through the door are the ones they always were; the entry's own rule (DOORTOOLS.lastOut) then
//                   gives the door they came in by to the last man through, from the inside — him.
//                   (REARWATCH.hold, off: he is kept on it until every other man of the entry is THROUGH the frame, REARWATCH.holdSecs at most. Built first
//                   and measured: the way behind was watched a second or two longer and the room was a gun short for it — over 18 seeds of the barracks
//                   with four, 31 teammates up against 41 with the rule off, 42 with him going on his turn. So he goes on his turn.)
//                   Where the room has no point for him (a small room, four men) he is the one the entry leaves outside, and the way behind stays his
//                   from there. (The door tool files the stack again behind the man who opens: where that file leaves no rear mark a line to the way, nobody
//                   is pinned through the entry — a mark is the stack's to move, not this rule's.)
//                   He is not the man picked to go FIRST either, while the other file has a front man (doortools.ts firstIn: 'who has seen most of the
//                   room' is asked of the others).
//   A PAIR          has no spare man once the door goes: its second man watches the way behind while the stack WAITS (as above), and both go in together.
//
// Nothing here moves a mark (stackroom.ts's), deals a pod, or decides a shot: a pinned gun is an aim, and who fires is the fight's (a team that has not been
// found is held by the same rules as on any other watch). State: a book per Game, DERIVED AGAIN EVERY FRAME from the orders and the doors' state — the one
// things remembered across frames are who had the watch (so it does not hop between two men) and when he last had his line (REARWATCH.grace: the worked
// door's own leaf swings across it), and losing them changes nothing but that. Nothing to save: a load starts the book afresh.
//
// A TAKEN ROOM'S OTHER DOOR, KEPT WHILE THE SQUAD LEAVES (REARWATCH.room; `?noroomkeep`, frozen stand off: TPS_ROOMKEEP=1; off = the build as it was).
// An entry that has ended leaves a man with his gun on each other door of the room nobody of the squad has been beyond (doortools.ts otherDoors, the
// threshold's holdDoors) — and lets go of him the frame ANY new order comes. 'Fall in' is such an order, given with the squad still standing in the room:
// every gun left the room's other doors at once. With the switch on the man who HAD such a door when 'fall in' came keeps it (roomKeepTick): the cover deals
// it to him first, as a stack's rear man's pin; his feet stay where they are, with no goal (orders.ts asks roomKept — a runner held at speed 0 on a goal
// still steers his chest at his next waypoint, and the twist clamp then drags his gun off the door and off a man he has seen); he is the last of the file.
// He is let go when the squad is out of the room, when the last man has passed him (Sam is out and the men who stood behind him then are all nearer Sam now),
// REARWATCH.roomSecs after Sam left whatever the others do, once Sam is REARWATCH.roomM from him, when the squad has been beyond that door or another order works or watches it — and then
// follows, last. An order that sends him to a mark ends the keep; if it is a stack and the kept door is still shut, that door counts as a way behind that
// stack while the squad is in the room (Book.shut, read by rearWays), so a rear man of the stack gets it by the rules above. Sam standing in the room keeps
// him on it. Nothing here deals a door: who has one is the entry's own rule, read a frame late. Not saved (a load: the entry's own hold is gone too).
