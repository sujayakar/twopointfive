// interior's carpet base ('interior floor finishes': floor(x0, z0, x1, z1, albedo)) and the exterior ground (asphalt slab, grass strips north and west); rugs,
// runners and mats are decals (NoShadow, a few mm proud) and deliberately do NOT count — the finish under them does — so the corridor is lino wall to wall,
// runner or not, and stays the reference every hearing number was tuned on.
