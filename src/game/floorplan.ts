// THE SQUAD AND THE PLAN, DRAWN ON THE FLOOR — what the page shows of OUR OWN men's orders, as marks on the ground.
//
// The maintainer (10-13): "it would be good to have the squad move to do a throw (and maybe visualize who's doing it and the path on the ground?)" — and the
// Door Kickers 2 focus list's item 6: "mark() is null once the menu closes; four placed men are four lines of text. Done looks like: cover the top-left
// corner: you still know each man's mark, sector and which door waits on F. Our men only."
//
// THIS FILE ONLY READS THE GAME. `floorPlan(g)` turns the squad's orders as they stand (orders.ts Assignment, each man's own nav path) into a short list of
// things for the overlay to draw (ui/planfloor.ts); nothing here moves a man, writes a field the simulation reads, rolls a die, or looks at a camera, a canvas
// or a pixel — it is built from the orders alone, so a second player would be handed the same marks. Only men of the player's own squad are ever listed
// (`SquadOrders.squad()`): nothing about a man of another side, seen or not.
//
// WHAT IS LISTED, per living man who has a MARK (a follower in the file behind the player has none: he is drawn by standing there):
//   · on his way: the WAY he will walk — his own nav path from his feet where it is this order's, else the nav grid's (asked at most every PLAN.reaskSecs),
//     on through the corners of a way round (`Assignment.via`) to the mark — the mark itself, and what he will watch from it;
//   · on his mark: the mark, and the way his gun really points now (the unasked cover, a fitted watch and the rear watch all end up in his aim: the fan is
//     what he is doing, not what the order first said);
//   · taken off his order by the fight (`yieldT`): the mark alone, as his to come back to; on a man while still under the order: all of it, dim.
// `doors` = everything WAITING ON THE PLAYER'S KEY, read off its owners' own books by their own rule for the press (`waitsOnKey`: doortools.ts `waiting4` /
// `thresholdHeld` / `set` / `input`, wallcharge.ts `set` / `input`, the room clear drill's 'set' — repeated here as a reader; if a rule moves, `plan-check`'s
// word lines say so): a threshold held, a charge set on a door or a wall, the drill stacked, and for the four a tool given 'on my word', a charge being set,
// a pair on a plain stack. The overlay lays a bar across the doorway (along the wall's foot) with the key on the one the key would send NOW (a quiet
// pair's man who waits on the mark has the key alone, a step ahead of him: see below, 'the quiet pair's mark').
// `age` = seconds since his order came: the overlay draws an order just given at full strength (who + the way), then lets it sink back.
// With the menu up, `who` = the men its orders go to (a ring at each one's feet, before anything is given).
//
// A TEAMMATE'S THROW (`throws`, PLAN.throws): squadthrow.ts's thrower is walked like any man (who, way and mark come out of the above); the arc and where
// the thing comes to rest are READ from that module's own reader, `squadThrowPlans(g)` — never worked out here — one entry per throw from the order until
// the thing leaves his hand, plus the throw page's highlighted row as a `preview` (who would throw, his walk, the arc: before anything is given). While
// this draws them the neighbour's own stopgap picture (ui/squadthrowviz.ts, SQUADTHROW.draw) stands down: it asks `planDrawsThrows()`.
//
// NOTHING OF AN ENEMY: a mark, a way or a watched point that an order took FROM a man of another side (`Assignment.foe`: the quiet pair's 'take him' /
// 'watch him' put the mark behind him and the watch on him, live) is listed only while the team's fog has him seen, and its watch never; a watched point is
// listed only where it is the order's own door, the room fit's, or the point the player himself gave (cover / move / hold) — a door tool's 'threat first'
// writes a sensed place there. A man the fight has (`yieldT`, or the room fight's own point on his script) is drawn dim: that he is fighting is on his body.
//
// A SECOND PLAYER: `men` are the squad's and would be the same for both; `who` (the open menu's men) and a door's `now` (the men orders go to, who is
// nearest a set charge, who is down) are the SEAT's — today the one player's, read off `g.orders` and `g.player` at the two marked places.
//
// PLAN.on: on on every stand (it is picture only: with nobody asking `floorPlan` nothing runs; asked, a run's digest is the same — tools/qa/plan-check.ts);
// `?noplan` in the page = nothing drawn, the HUD as it was. IT KEEPS NOTHING OF ITS OWN: the nav grid's answer for a leg, kept between asks, lives with
// whoever asks (`PlanKept`: the overlay's own table in ui/planfloor.ts, a check's own Map — attention.ts attentionWay's rule), and the grid is searched
// on the asker's tables too (`kept.nav`, NavGrid.findPathAside), so asking for the men's ways and the laid orders writes nothing of the game's. The
// throw page's preview, read through squadthrow.ts `squadThrowPlans`, is asked aside in the same way, on the store this one carries for it
// (`kept.throws`, squadthrow.ts SquadThrowKept; tools/qa/throwview-check.ts).
