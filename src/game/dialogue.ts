// Interrogation dialogue engine (docs/internal/grab-interrogate-design.md §4, slice 5): a pure-ish function over state the AI already keeps — each man's own
// witness record (game.ts Witness: what HE saw and heard), his sightings, the floor's alarm level, the net's radio check, the lockdown duties — that answers
// 'Sam has this man by the throat and leans on him: what does he say?'. Three axes pick the cell: KNOWLEDGE of Sam (none / heard / glimpsed / saw / sawHurt —
// his own perception only, never the floor's), AGITATION (0‥1 → low / mid / high, from the floor state, what he personally went through, how long he has been
// held, and his temperament), TEMPERAMENT (game.ts TEMPERAMENT: steady / nervy / hard). Each cell has STAGES — 1 the reaction, 2 the pressure, 3 the one useful
// thing he plausibly knows (the INTEL generator) or the admission / refusal that he has none, then 'x', nothing left, tapped for as long as you like — each a
// small pool sampled without repeats per man. Nothing here imports the game beyond types and three read-only values (TEMPERAMENT, rollcallState, escalationOf);
// gather() and the small readers it is built from (knowledgeOf, agitationOf, the token resolvers) are all that touch a Game — the picker works on the plain
// DialogueCtx gather returns (the QA probes synthesize those by hand to sweep the whole matrix). Nothing is written back but the man's own Talk record.
//
// The grab (player.ts startGrab / updateHold) owns 'held': while Guard.held is set its `since` IS the held clock and nothing here touches it; the sandbox
// button's bare exchange with a man nobody holds still stamps talk.heldSince itself and lets it lapse (heldSinceOf), so the probes can sweep the matrix.
//
// An exchange in the arm is two speakers (player.ts askHeld): SAM's line first — SAM_LINES below, picked by pickSamLine for the exchange that is coming
// (his first words / leaning on him / asking for the useful thing, worded for the very thing the man is about to give when peekGive says he will / the last
// word to a man who has nothing left), coloured by the hold's variant, the floor and the man — then, when Sam's bubble ends, the man's answer through
// interrogate() exactly as before. Nothing on the man's side moves until he answers: Sam's pick only reads the context. Questions are the ARM hold's
// (the knife at his throat): with the pistol drawn to his head (E mid-hold, player.ts swapHold) a tap asks nothing until it is holstered again — the one
// place the [gun] lines still reach the air is Sam's remark as he draws (samRemarkFor). One answer does something besides being said: the man who gives
// the keyed door up ('…mine's on my belt') gives his key up with it — game.ts interrogate → player.ts takeKey — and Sam's word on THAT (the 'key' remarks,
// samKeyLineFor) follows his line down.
//
// ============================================================================================================================================================
//   SHAPES (the G7 pass). Most holds now play a SCRIPT: one comic shape — count pedantry, the self-own, the over-cooperator, the rambler, the fan, the stoic,
//   the con, the arbitrary game, the room's own menace — written as four beats for the four staged presses, Sam's line and the man's answer authored TOGETHER
//   (and on some beats Sam's rejoinder once the answer is down: Hold.after, the mechanism his word on a pocketed key already used), dealt per man from his
//   callsign among the scripts that fit his temperament, what he knows of Sam and how rattled he is, and kept for the whole hold (SCRIPTS, at the end of the
//   file, with ROOM_MENACE, the handler's radio and the ambient pairs). The useful thing still comes from the INTEL generator at the giving stages — in the
//   shape's voice where a variant is written — through the same tokens, and the keyed door still puts the man's key in Sam's pocket. The LINES / SAM_LINES
//   pools below are the fallback voice: a man who watched Sam hurt somebody (sawHurt: frightened, never funny), the fifth press and after, a script line whose
//   token went null mid-hold, a synthetic context nothing fits. lintDialogue() holds every speaker to the same rules: ≤ MAX_CHARS (aim ≤ AIM_CHARS) after the
//   longest token expansion, Sam ≤ SAM_MAX_CHARS, tokens only from TOKENS, needs only from NEEDS, and not one phrase off the ORIGINALITY_BLOCKLIST.
