// THE ROOM READ — one stateless answer to "what is the space round this point, and what leads out of it": the floor a man standing there shares with it, every
// WAY out of that floor (a door, a leafless gap, the mouth of a passage: cover.ts's own openings, nothing authored), which side of each way the space lies on,
// and whether the floor beyond it is ground the team already knows (cleared.ts). Two things read it and neither owns the facts: where the men stand and what
// each watches when Sam sends them to a spot (roomfit.ts), and the squad clearing a room it was sent into.
//
//   THE SPACE   the nav cells walked to from the point without crossing a door's frame, a gap's line or a passage's mouth, no further than `reach` metres of
//               walking. Finer than cleared.ts's room (which runs on through every leafless doorway): the office behind a doorway with no leaf is its own
//               space, and the doorway is a way out of it. Open ground has a space too: what is in reach.
//   A WAY       an opening whose line borders that floor. `inN` points from it INTO the space; `beyond` is a stride past it on the other face; `far` /
//               `farKnown` are cleared.ts's room there and whether one of the team has stood in it (open floor counts as known: cleared.ts's own rule);
//               `shut` / `locked` are the leaf's, as they stand now.
// PURE: it writes nothing, keeps nothing, draws no dice, moves nobody — the same answer for the same level, door states and known rooms, whoever asks and
// however often. (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
