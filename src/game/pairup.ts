// THE PAIR — two person stealth as ONE thing: the switch over its three parts, and the rules that only exist once the three are in one build.
//
// The play note (10-08): "oh we also haven't tried anything with two person stealth yet, we should try this and polish". The three parts, each behind its own
// switch (each still works alone, and each alone is its own part's build):
//   pairorders.ts  PAIR.on     the quiet ORDERS for one partner (take him on your mark / now, watch him, hold in the dark; F is the mark)
//   sneak.ts       SNEAK.on    how he FOLLOWS while nobody has noticed (low with Sam, in Sam's steps, waits short of a lit stretch somebody is looking at)
//   spotted.ts     SPOTTED.on  what he does once a defender is SUSPICIOUS, and once the pair is CAUGHT
//
// THE SWITCH. `PAIRUP.on`, OFF by default: `?pair` for the visit (`?pair=0` off), PAIR=1 in the harness's environment, Tab ▸ Sandbox ▸ 'The pair (two person
// stealth)'. On, it turns the three parts on (pairUpApply, from the Game's constructor and from the panel's row) and switches these rules in — each with its
// own row, so one can be put back to see what it was doing:
//   oneEye   ONE judgement of 'seen'. The orders' stalk (the way round to a man's back) asks the SNEAK's eye, step for step: guards.ts's own eye test from every
//            defender to a man low on that floor, widened as the sneak widens it (a glance travels), lit by the sneak's bar or at his elbow — and it is
//            PRICED the sneak's way: what walking the watched steps would add to the most stirred watcher's awareness by the eye's own arithmetic, with the
//            sneak's margin, inside the sneak's budget. Off: the stalk's own rule (lit floor inside `coneM` 9 m of a defender looking that way, his near
//            field whatever the light). One model: the partner no longer walks a stretch on a take order that he would have waited short of following Sam,
//            nor refuses one he would have crossed.
//   hunted   the sneak does not stop the moment ANY defender is alert or searching (as it does alone: sneak.ts sneakLive) — the partner goes on sneaking
//            until the PAIR is caught (spotted.ts 'caught': an alert man with his eyes on one of them, or loud in their ears). Alone, the two parts left a
//            gap: a defender searching for a noise two rooms off, and the partner walked upright into the light exactly when the floor was looking hardest.
//            A hunting man's eye is priced as the eye prices it (twice as quick on the uptake).
//   rejoin   a partner sent on a take order from Sam's shoulder FALLS IN again when the man is down ('he's down. on you.') — and so sneaks again. Off: he
//            holds where the man fell, as the orders part alone has it. A job called off (no way, watched, blown) leaves him holding either way: where
//            next is Sam's call.
//   stay     where a mission's own flow peels a following teammate off to cover an opening on Sam's route (the hostage rescue: rescueflow.ts), it leaves the
//            ONE partner at Sam's shoulder while the squad is silent and has not been compromised. Off: the flow takes him as it takes any follower — gun
//            up on an opening, alone, a third of the quiet walk (played: he was following in 63 to 83 % of the calm seconds of a rescue, 100 % elsewhere).
//   word     the squad line says why a following partner is not at Sam's shoulder (the sneak's word: 'waiting on eyes', 'crossing', …).
//   hands    ONE takedown. spotted.ts has hands of its own (a roused man turned to him at arm's length is taken by hand): (1) a take ORDER blown with the
//            partner a pace or two from the man's back is finished by those hands — turned to him or not — instead of ending with a gun on a man who is
//            about to shout (pairorders.ts takeTick; then 'rejoin' as after any take); (2) a man with THOSE hands on him sees nobody until they are off,
//            as a man in the order's hands does (PAIR.grip; guards.ts asks pairGripped). Off: a blown job stands and covers, and spotted's hands shield nothing.
// AND ALWAYS, wherever two parts are on together (nothing to switch: these are who-wins rules, not behaviour of their own):
//   FEET     a following partner's feet are spotted.ts's while it gives him a spot (freeze / slip / step: a defender is suspicious of them, or has them),
//            else the sneak's step along Sam's trail, else the order's own place; he is low if any of the three says low (orders.ts, the order() call).
//   ONE VOICE  while spotted.ts has him (a suspicious man about, or caught) the sneak says nothing over the net: spotted's line is the cue.
//   CAUGHT ENDS A TAKE JOB  a take order whose hands are not yet on the man is off the frame spotted.ts says the pair is caught — the same exit as the man
//            himself noticing — and he stands with his gun on the man who has them; none is GIVEN while they are caught ("they're onto us. no hands.").
//            Not on the last paces once sent (inside the ring, on his way, nothing between): there he finishes it, and until the man is down his gun and
//            his chest are nobody else's (pairorders.ts finishing: spotted's gun watch and the room fight's targets both stand off).
//
// NEVER a buff: nothing here changes a defender, a meter, a weapon or what a man can take. It is all about where the partner chooses to put his feet and when.
//
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load — the three tables are only touched inside
//  pairUpApply, which the Game's constructor calls.)
