// THE PARTNER SNEAKS — how a teammate FOLLOWS while the squad is silent and nobody has noticed it.
//
// The play note (10-08): "oh we also haven't tried anything with two person stealth yet, we should try this and polish". Measured on the build before this
// (tools/qa/pairsneak.ts, rebuild/pair-stealth/partner-sneaks.md): a silent teammate told to fall in walks UPRIGHT at the walk's pace whatever Sam does, closes
// up in bursts (his slowest pace is over Sam's crouch-walk), cuts straight to his place in the file — and stands or walks in a lit doorway a defender is looking
// at because Sam, low and quick, went through it a second earlier. The dark keeps him; the lit, watched stretches are where he gives the pair away.
//
// What he does differently with SNEAK.on, while he FOLLOWS (orders.ts 'fall in'), the squad is SILENT (silent.ts), not compromised, and no defender is hunting:
//   LOW WITH SAM   Sam crouched, he is crouched — and at Sam's own pace plus what closes the gap, with no floor under it (`minPace`): he creeps when Sam
//                  creeps instead of walking up and stopping. Low, his legs are asked for no more than `lowPace`. He is low whenever he waits or crosses, too.
//   IN SAM'S STEPS he walks Sam's own trail — every crumb of it, kept `trailM` long, not the last ten metres with a bee-line to his place: the line Sam chose
//                  through the dark is the line he takes, also when he is catching up from a wait. He closes to `back` metres further back than loud.
//   LOOKS BEFORE HE STEPS  the next `aheadM` of the trail is read a few times a second: how LIT each step is (the CPU's estimate of the direct light there, plus
//                  what Sam's own meter read there over that estimate as he walked it) and which defenders have a LINE to a crouched man on it (guards.ts's
//                  own eye: 16 m, head to chest or head) — and of those, who is LOOKING that way now (his cone, `coneDeg` wider: a glance travels). A step is
//                  EXPOSED when it is lit and has a line (or is inside `nearM` of a defender's eye, lit or not: a shape at his elbow is seen in the dark).
//   WAITS          an exposed stretch ahead that somebody is looking at: he stops short of it, low and still, where he is not exposed — and says so, once, over
//                  the net (`cue`: 'holding. it's lit and he's looking.'; after `nagSecs` 'can't cross while it's lit. he's still on it.' — the cue for Sam: put the light out,
//                  or go on without him). A stretch somebody IS looking at he never walks into; one too long to cross in a go (`crossM`) with a line
//                  on it but nobody looking, he gives `patience` seconds and then takes at the next moment nobody looks (0 = never).
//                  A door swinging shut between him and the man who was looking does not un-see it: he takes him to be looking still, for `memory` seconds.
//   CROSSES        the same stretch with every eye that has a line to it turned away: he goes, low, at `crossPace`, to the first step past it that is NOT
//                  exposed (past his place in the file if need be, never inside `standNear` of Sam) and does not stop in it. And LOOKED AT, when it is cheap:
//                  what the crossing would add to each looker's awareness by the eye's own arithmetic (light^1.5 × distance × the crouch), with a margin,
//                  inside `budget` — a step of dim light at range costs a watcher nothing; a man Sam has just stirred has none to spare.
//   STANDS IN THE DARK  Sam stopped: his place is the nearest step along the trail that is NOT exposed (lit with a line, whoever is looking) — on towards Sam
//                  or back the way they came, never the lit doorway behind Sam's shoulder; with no dark step short of Sam he holds in the dark behind and
//                  says so. No such step anywhere on the trail (it runs straight at an open door): he steps ASIDE, off the trail, out of the door's line (`side`). The cover's unasked step to see through a door (cover.ts) is not taken while he sneaks.
//   CLEAR OF A DOOR (`door`) Sam at a SHUT door, about to open it, and a defender beyond it: the lit steps in that man's line through the doorway (the frame read
//                  `doorPad` wider) are exposed as if it stood open — he waits short of them, or steps back / aside out of them, BEFORE the leaf moves, says
//                  so once, and is still when it opens — and until the leaf has been at rest `doorSettle` s (a leaf half way round hides a line for a moment only).
//   CAUGHT IN THE OPEN  seen where he stands (his OWN bones and his OWN meter, whatever the read of the trail said — a light came back on, a door swung open)
//                  and looked at, or stood still in it: to the same nearest dark step, at a creep — once, not hopping about (`hideGap`).
//   SENT TO A MARK (`post`) the rescue flow's cover, a move / cover of Sam's (never a hold): he walks there low while Sam is low, at no more than `lowPace`, and is low on it —
//                  a plain posted walk is upright at the brisk pace with the gun up, across whatever is lit on the way. Posture and pace only: he does not wait.
// What it does NOT do (other parts' seams): nothing once a defender is alert or searching or the squad is compromised (every rule returns null and he is the
// build's own follower — the compromise part's); no new order, no menu row (the orders part's); nothing for a man on a stack or a door tool's marks.
// HONEST LIMITS: the light AHEAD of him is the CPU's direct-light estimate (no bounce, no moon: guards.ts lightEstimateAt) plus what Sam's meter — the
// renderer's, in the page — read over it where Sam walked (`ambient`); his own meter where he STANDS is the renderer's too, and 'caught in the open' reads
// that. Headless both meters ARE the estimate, so the ambient term is untested there. He knows a defender only by the line from
// that man to the step he is about to take (he looks before he steps — he is not told who is behind a wall, and a wall is why he is safe from him);
// a defender who walks INTO view while he is mid-stretch is not predicted.
// A SKILL KNOB is left open (the play note: a partner's sneaking skill "can vary", "only the player is truly amazing at it"): SNEAK.skill scales how far he
// looks ahead and how wide he reads a glance — 1 = this competent partner; the page lists the call.
//
// OFF (the default; `?sneak` / SNEAK=on / the panel's row turn it on): every function below returns on its first line and orders.ts's follower is the build's
// own, frame for frame (the run digests agree). State is per Game in a WeakMap: nothing on the Game, in the digest or in a checkpoint. No dice.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
