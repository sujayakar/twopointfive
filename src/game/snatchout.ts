// HOW A SNATCH ENDS (SNATCHOUT; snatch.ts asks here while the switch is up and the level's block names a van). The maintainer, having played it: "i was
// expecting to have to grab him and exfil him though (while my squad handles holding off the response force), not needing to clear the structure. like maybe we
// need to get him to a van near our infil".
//
//   WHAT WAS THERE   the house taken with him alive and in hand was the win, and he was held where he gave up: nowhere to take him.
//   THE RULE         tied, he is LED: a row on him (Space, 'on your feet — with me') and he gets up and follows whoever said it, on the civilians' own legs
//                    (civilians.ts hostageLead: the walk a rescue's hostages have, his wrists still behind him); the same row then reads 'stay here'. The
//                    level's block names the team's VAN by its way in (scenarios.snatch.van): the leader inside `sendM` of its open doors with him close
//                    behind and he walks the last steps himself, and the moment he is at them he is IN (off the floor) and the mission is WON — men of
//                    theirs alive in the house or not. In Sam's arm, or out cold in his hands, he is in once Sam stands at the doors.
//   LOST is as it was: out by a way of his own, or dead by anybody's round or grenade. Tied is still for good.
//   THE SQUAD (`hold`)  nobody is asked: from the word, the teammates who were with the leader cover the walk out BY BOUNDS — one pair plants (a hold that
//                    names nothing to watch, so cover.ts deals each man one of the doors and gaps a man could come at them by, no two the same), never in
//                    a doorway, on the leader's way out or on a mate; left `trailM` behind, it comes up at the squad's own pace while the pair that was
//                    with the leader plants in its place. While one planted man fights, or one has just gone down, the other's gun goes to where that is.
//                    A man the player has given an order since is the player's: the order stands and this lets go of him (the Assignment is not ours
//                    any more). Nobody in a fight is called off it.
//
// Off (the module's default, the frozen stand) = the build as it was. On in the page (host/profile.ts pageSwitches; ?nosnatchout, ?nosnatchhold) and on the
// shipped stand; TPS_SNATCHOUT=1 raises it on a frozen run. UNTUNED by play.
// Per-player state (habit: 'which player, not the player'): the one who gave the word is kept as a character, never read off Game.player after the press.
