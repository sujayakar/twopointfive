// A GUARD HAS ONE ATTENTION, AND WHERE IT IS CAN BE SEEN (the maintainer, 10-13: "we can try to play with some mechanics where guards' attention could be
// redirected elsewhere (e.g. apollo robbins psychology stuff) but we should make sure it's legible and fun"). Robbins's picture of it is a spotlight with one
// man behind it: put on a thing, it is not on the rest. Until this file a small noise only made a man MORE dangerous — wary, turning, sweeping the room for as
// long as his suspicion took to drain, with nothing to say where he was looking or when he would stop. Now a small thing that makes a calm man look TAKES his
// attention to the place he puts it, for a time he shows:
//   · WHAT TAKES IT: anything his ears or eyes already answer by going to look or turning his head (guards.ts hearingCheck's small things — a whistle he
//     answers, a door, a knock or a clack, a carton shot across the room, a lamp dying in his view) — nothing is heard further than it was. Never his own
//     side's noise, never a footfall (that is YOU, and it breaks a hold: below), never anything loud (a slam, glass, a shot: those rouse him as they did).
//     ONE thing is made to work as it was written to: a knock MADE TO BE LOOKED AT (GameEvent.lure — the ring airfoil's clack off a wall, launcher.ts: 'they go
//     and look at IT') that reaches a calm man at all lifts him to `drawAw`, so he does go and look — by its own level a single clack left him under the
//     'huh?' line at every distance. The ring is this game's thrown bottle. A faint knock nobody made to be looked at (a chair a door swept) is no lure.
//     And a thing another file LENDS it to for as long as it says so (attentionLend: a man at a lit screen — the dark-rooms file's — is one more holder).
//   · WHERE IT GOES: the place he puts the thing — the source through open air, the doorway or corner it came round otherwise (hearingCheck's own `heardAt`).
//   · HOW LONG: while he walks over, and then `…Secs` of looking AT it (not round the room: the old five-second sweep is what made the wait unreadable). A thing
//     he only turns his head to holds it for the turn of the head.
//   · WHAT IT COSTS HIM: outside `focusDeg` of the line from his eye to the thing, what he sees of a man builds at `sideK` of the rate, writes no fix, and a
//     footfall reaches his ear at `earK`. INSIDE it he is as sharp as ever, and so is the point-blank floor (guards.ts sightGain, under 1.8 m): GUARD_EYE and
//     the close rule's dark numbers are not touched — the hold is geometry and time, never light.
//   · WHAT BREAKS IT: `breakGain` of awareness glimpsed past the edge of it ('—wait.' and he turns to YOU), a footfall that reaches him, anything loud, a body,
//     an errand, a grab, a fight. Broken, he is the wary man he always was, with his whole eye — and what he half-saw at the edge stays with him when the
//     look ends. (A man still at his own business under a hold — a lent one, a turned head — keeps no sum: it breaks when his awareness itself gets there.)
//   · HE IS NOT A FOOL (the maintainer: "we don't want them to feel dumb"): every taking inside `memorySecs` is shorter by `wearK` and he says so; the
//     `spent`-th is no look at all — he draws and searches the place (the whistle's own 'twice' rule, whistle.ts, stands beside this and is not changed).
//     Things inside `sameSecs` of each other are one happening (a canister's bounces, a thing dragged): one taking, which follows it.
//   · HOW HE SHOWS IT (attentionMarks → ui/attentionviz.ts; show, not tell — no word, no number): a thread on the floor from him to the place and a ring there
//     that runs down like a clock once he is at it; `tellSecs` before the end he SAYS he is done ('must have been nothing' moves here from the walk back), and
//     only then does the eye widen. Nothing is drawn of a man the fog of war hides.
// ONE switch, ATTENTION.on: ON in the page (?noattention = the build as it was), OFF here and on the frozen harness stand (TPS_ATTENTION=1; a FROZEN_HOLDS row).
// With it off every export returns on its first line. No dice but the line pools (simRandom), no camera, no graphics setting; per-man state in a WeakMap with a
// snapshot / restore pair (savestate.ts). Type-only game imports but for functions called inside functions (src/game is one import cycle).
