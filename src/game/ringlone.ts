// A RING WITH ONE ROW IS A PILL (HANDRING.lone; the maintainer, 10-23: "the radial menus are getting better but need some work. to start they look weird
// when they just have one option"). The wheel is five places a fifth of a turn each, and a ring with one row was one slice of it with four places bare:
// on open floor his own ring was a lone slice out to one side (the whistle), and a tutorial mission's frame leaves many rings one row (every squad ring
// of the first mission).
//
// THE PICTURE (ui/cmdring.ts RingDraw draws it, index.html `.cmdring .lone …` is the look). One row: no slice. A small ring round the middle (the hole
// the wheel had, so what is pointed at still shows through) and one pill beside it, out the way that row's wedge lay, its digit at the end by the
// middle and its words inside. Lit, the pill is filled as a lit wedge is. Two rows or more: the wheel, as it was.
//
// THE CURSOR ON THE PILL IS ON THE ROW (cmdring.ts ringWant, both rings): a wedge is a fifth of a turn and a pill of words is wider than that where
// its wedge points up, so the pill's digit lay in the next wedge's fifth and a key let go there gave nothing. With one row, the cursor anywhere on
// the pill's place is that row's; the wedge's own fifth is still its too. Nothing else is added: a cursor out any other way lights nothing, so a
// row is still chosen, never fallen into.
//
// THE GAME READS A PLACE, NOT THE WORDS (`pillBox`): the place a pill may lie in is as long as the longest pill (`LONE.max` letters), whatever this
// row says, so which row a recorded cursor lit never turns on how a label is worded (a recording keeps the cursor's px, and labels are reworded).
// The pill drawn is as long as its own words and always inside that place: its width is counted from the words, never measured, and the page sets
// its words to that width (a line longer than `max` is drawn tighter, never longer — the next paragraph has what a long label does first).
//
// A LONG LABEL TAKES TWO LINES (HANDRING.loneWrap; the maintainer, 10-23, of a wall's second ring with one row, 'breach with a wall charge · 3 left':
// "weird after hitting 5"). Thirty-four letters set to the width of twenty ran into each other. Under the rule a label longer than `max` is broken
// at its ' · ' where both halves then fit (the line break says what the dot said, so the dot is dropped), else at the space that leaves its longer
// line shortest; the pill is two lines tall (`lead` taller, growing away from the middle so it stays clear of the middle's ring) and each line is set to its
// own counted width, so a letter is squeezed only where the best break still leaves a line longer than `max`. The place the game reads is two lines
// tall with it, whatever the row says, so the pill drawn is still always inside its place (a short pill's place gains that band too: away from the
// middle, and less than the room the place already keeps past a short pill's end). Off: one line, drawn tighter, as it was.
//
// This file is the shape, with no page under it (handring-check asks it).
