// WALL BREAKING — the destruction engine for what a loud fight does to the LEVEL ITSELF: interior partition walls and cover come apart under rounds and blasts
// ("walls and cover break apart in a firefight"). It hangs off the destruction lane (game/destruction.ts: `g.destr.walls`), behind THE ONE SWITCH of the
// destruction goal (game/destructionSwitch.ts DESTRUCTION.on — off in the module, the page raises it; off = the one build by digest), the lane's knob
// (`tune.chaos` 0 = nothing here ever runs) and its own `tune.wallBreak` (default on; off = the lane before this).
//
// WHAT BREAKS (found by SHAPE once at construction, like the lane's paper and clutter — the runtime Box carries no material key):
//   WALL   an interior partition: a floor-standing, full-height (top ≥ 2.2 m), thin (≤ 17 cm), unrotated static in the 'wall' paint with ceiling over both of its
//          faces. Cut into 0.5 m COLUMNS of two cells: the SILL (floor → 0.7 m) and the UPPER (0.7 m → top).
//            · sustained FIRE into a column knocks its upper out — a PORT: rounds, eyes and sound pass over the sill, feet do not;
//            · fire kept on a sill whose upper is gone takes the sill too; a BLAST opens whole columns — a HOLE a man walks through (≥ 3 columns = 1.5 m wide
//              when a charge goes off against the wall).
//   COVER  floor-standing wood / cardboard / fabric-partition / low plaster furniture big enough to stand behind (crates, pallets, desk panels, shelving, low
//          partitions). Cut into ~0.5 m plan cells; a cell that has taken its rounds is GONE top to bottom (chewed from the shooter's side inward), a blast takes
//          every cell it reaches. What stood on it falls (the lane's own knock-offs for clutter and paper, a rigid chunk for the rest).
//   Thick / concrete / outer walls, metal and anything that lights or carries a fixture only SCAR (the lane's marks, as before) — but for the ONE wall a breaching
//   charge is set on (`adopt`, BlastOpts.breach — wallcharge.ts WALLCHARGE.outer: an outer wall): that wall is taken on as a HARD wall on the frame its charge
//   goes, opened by that blast alone (a hole of minHole columns, no ports) and by nothing after it; rounds still only scar it. DOORS and GLASS are not this
//   module's: a blast reaches the doors through Destruction.blast's call list (g.doors.blast, then the wall is judged) and anyone else through destr.onBlast (the
//   glass hears a charge off its own 'bang' event as it always did); their state is their own, and
//   they may file their own rows in the feed (`walls.note`).
//
// ONE MODEL. A broken thing is broken for everyone because it is broken in the ONE place every question is asked of: the level's static boxes. The authored box
// is hidden (NoPrimary | NoShadow — the flags every ray, the raster and every CPU query already honour at query time) and what still stands is rebuilt as PIECES:
// plain static boxes APPENDED to the level's list (StaticCollision.addStatic + BoxWorld.addStatic, registered in the authored box's cells), greedy-merged from
// the closed cells, re-shaped in place as more goes. So rounds (col.raycast), sight (segmentBlocked), sound / reach (solidBlocked + SoundPaths, its route cache
// dropped), feet (collideCircle), the trace grid and raster (BoxWorld.upload re-packs changed statics), the smoke solver's obstacles and the lights' reach masks
// (Game.reachChanged: only the cells behind the opening are decided again, a few lights a frame) all read the same boxes. The NAV GRID is re-baked over the changed footprint with the constructor's own
// statement (NavGrid.rebake) and the cells that became floor are handed to the AI.
//
// THE AI IS TOLD: `walls.serial` goes up with every change and `walls.changes` (a ring of LevelChange rows: kind hole | port | cover | door | reset, where, the nav
// cells that opened, whether a man fits through, whose doing) says what; `walls.onChange(fn)` calls back on the frame; `walls.since(serial)` reads the tail.
//
// A ROUND NEVER GOES ON PAST WHAT IT HIT here: the one place a round is stopped stays combat.ts fireWeapon's `g.col.raycast` — an opened cell is simply not there
// for the NEXT round's ray. Nothing in this module continues, splits or re-fires a round (no second round loop to keep in step with the glass goal's).
//
// BOUNDED: ≤ WALLS.maxPieces appended statics (a change that would need more is REFUSED — the round only scars — and counted), the lane's debris pool for what
// falls, ≤ WALLS.maxChanges rows. DETERMINISTIC: no Math.random, every choice hashes the module's own counter. RESET with the level (Destruction.reset): authored
// boxes back as they were, appended statics cut off, nav re-baked. CHECKPOINTS carry it: savestate.ts files `snapshot()` and re-applies it after the restart; the
// level fingerprint is taken over the AUTHORED statics only.

   *  picture: a listed wall is read with no studs at all, so a line through a stud bay reads open), and whatever the opening then lets fall (`settle`).
