// NOT IN THERE ALONE — THE DARK DOORWAY (the maintainer, 10-13, of the morale work: "especially for stealth sections that aren't perfect ghost where enemies just
// don't [know] what's going on, more poorly trained ones could get really scared and refuse to go into dark rooms" — and "a lot of the value from this comes with
// good telegraphing": he SAYS it, then he DOES it, with a beat the player can act on).
//
//   · WHO BALKS: a GREEN man (greenMan: morale.ts trainingOf) who is ALARMED (suspicious, searching or alert: he knows something is
//     out there — a calm man on his own beat walks his dark rooms as he always has), who is ALONE (no living mate inside `pairM` with a line to him), who stands
//     in the LIGHT (his own place reads `darkAt` on the meter, or `litBy` brighter than the room ahead: a man already in the dark has no lit side of a door to
//     stop on — and in a blackout nobody balks at all), and whose walk's next doorway, inside `stopM` ahead, stands OPEN onto a room that is DARK (a shut leaf
//     he opens as he always did: he cannot know what is behind it — then he balks, and steps back). His own torch does not exempt him. A steady man, a man with
//     a mate at his shoulder, a lit room: all walk in exactly as they did. Never a choreographed man, a trained one (the response team), a man of the hostage
//     rescue's cast, a man morale.ts has in a sequence, a man in the standoff over a held colleague, a man on an errand he was SENT on (the breaker, a silent
//     colleague's route, a body he was called to). IN A FIGHT only a chase to a last-known fix is stopped: not a man with a sighting newer than `seenSecs`, not
//     a walk to cover, not a man closing on a foe who is down.
//   · THE DARK ROOM: the room on the far face of the doorway (cleared.ts's rooms: a flood from the door's floor; open floor is nobody's room and never counts),
//     `samples` of its floor cells read for the PLACE's steady light (calmtorch.ts placeLight: nothing anybody carries, no flash) — dark when `darkShare` of
//     them read under `darkAt` on the meter. Read once per `askSecs` a room, whoever asks; the readings ride a checkpoint.
//   · THE BALK: he stops a stride short of the frame (`standM`), off the middle of the doorway toward his own jamb (`sideM`) — not in the opening, with a view
//     through it — and SAYS it as he stops. With a mate to call the line IS the call: spoken if that man is inside `earM`, on the net with the handset's chirp
//     otherwise; the mate answers after `copySecs`. With nobody to call it is a different line, said to himself. Then he SWEEPS: his aim, and his light with it,
//     goes slowly across the opening and back (`sweepSecs` a pass) for as long as he waits. The mate is the free man of his side with the shortest WALK to him
//     inside `mateM` (of the `mateTry` nearest; asked again every `callSecs` while nobody is coming): he walks to him (the floor's own 'suspicious' walk to a
//     fix, the fix kept on the caller — what guards.ts sendCheckOn does to a man, less the errand). When that mate, or any man free to come, is inside `pairM`
//     with a line to him, the mate says so and they go in together: the first man's walk resumes and the mate's fix is the first man's goal for `withSecs`. A
//     mate who dies, is taken by something else, or covers no ground for `lagSecs` is dropped and the next man called.
//   · NEVER A SAFE ROOM FOR GOOD: nobody inside `waitSecs` and he says so and GIVES THE ROOM UP: every spot of his search in it is struck off, and the leg is
//     dropped by the walk's own rule for a leg that goes nowhere (a suspicion's fix is where he stands; a chase is dropped to a search of where he stands —
//     never with a foe in his eyes: the wait's clock stands while he has one). The `fedUpN`th time he is sent at that ROOM inside `fedUpSecs` he NERVES
//     HIMSELF: says it, stands `nerveSecs`, and goes in alone at `slowK` of his pace, light first. A door he has gone through, with a mate or alone, does not
//     stop him again for `againSecs`. An enemy seen INSIDE the room while he waits does not take him in: he fires from where he stands by the floor's own alert
//     rules, untouched.
//   · A man called, and a pair going in, are never balked: two men sent to look are not alone.
// SHOW, NOT TELL: nothing is drawn or written for the player but the men themselves. No die at all, no wall clock, no graphics setting: the light is the CPU's
// steady estimate (the same number on the page and in the harness); the clocks are seconds COUNTED and ride a checkpoint (darkDoorSnapshot / Restore).
