// The HOSTAGE RESCUE playtest (?rescue · native --rescue · __rescue · Tab ▸ Sandbox ▸ Hostage rescue). The night breach (nightbreach.ts) asked whether a team entry
// reads as a fight and the room clear (roomclear.ts) whether a structure can be taken room by room; this asks the next thing: does it still work when the team has
// to FLOW — run past rooms it has not cleared, because somebody at the far end of the corridor is about to be shot. The office at night; the shift, the cleaner and
// the late worker, the response team and the cameras off the floor, as under the night breach (the same four gates). Design: the 'fast rescue' answer page's
// section 3. It stands on the room clear's build: the pair are ordered through its command menu (orders.ts — press X), both sides shoot on their own read
// (roomfight.ts), and its fog of war is on under the flag.
//
//   WHO IS WHERE   two HOSTAGES (civilians of the usual make, down and told to stay down — civilians.ts spawnHostage) along the north wall of the manager's office;
//                  a CAPTOR in the office with his gun on the corridor door; a DOOR MAN in the corridor's east half (knob: just inside the office instead); a ROAMER
//                  who comes to the noise — in the break room or the conference room, drawn at each staging. Sam and two operatives (Blue One, Blue Two) at the lobby arch, the corridor's west end: the conference
//                  room, the cubicles' two openings and the server room all lie between them and the hostages.
//   CLOCK ONE      the captor's. `resolve` runs 0 → 1 over RESCUE.resolveSecs (drawn ± resolveSpread at each staging, so it cannot be counted — unless samestart.ts is on: then it is the knob's to the second, every try) from the moment the
//                  clock starts — hot start (default): Sam's first move, shot or order; quiet start: the first thing a defender hears or sees. At 1 the captor
//                  turns on the nearest hostage, takes aimSecs to line up, and fires; the second hostage follows secondHostageSecs later. A dazzled captor's clock
//                  stands still (the charge is the window), a dead captor's passes to whoever of his side is alive in the room — who is secondHostageSecs from
//                  doing it at the soonest, however far the last man had got — and with nobody of theirs in the room it stops. He shouts it (three steps: shouting / counting / about to); the message line says when the step changes and the panel's summary which it is.
//   CLOCK TWO      every defender's. UNSET until setSecs after he first learns the assault is on (his own ears and eyes: the AI's hearing puts him off 'patrol';
//                  at a hot start the captor begins SET — captorSet): a man caught unset reacts late (unsetReact from the moment he first SEES one of the team)
//                  and, dazzled, stands and stares. SET, he is the room fight's defender as it has him: gun on the entry his own ears fear (the way he was put,
//                  until he has heard something), and dazzled he empties a burst blind down it. The roamer's 'set' is setting OFF: he is let off his post to
//                  hunt the last loud thing the team did (the room fight may have sent him to the gunfire sooner, by his own ears).
//   THE TEAM       the room clear's squad: the X menu's orders for where they are and what they watch — fall in, hold, move there, stack up, cover (orders.ts) and
//                  the DOOR TOOLS on any door, the hostage room's two included: open and clear, bang and clear, breach with a charge, clear from outside
//                  (doortools.ts — the same rows, keys and counts as under the room clear: 2 charges and 3 bangs a staging) — and the room fight for when they
//                  shoot. At a hot start the pair FALL IN the moment the clock starts, without being told (dynamic tempo: whatever Sam passes, they pass).
//   F              GO ON THE HOSTAGE ROOM. A charge set on a door has the press first, as everywhere (doortools.ts: F blows it — and under the rescue the charges
//                  on BOTH of the room's doors go on the one press). Otherwise F is the menu's 'bang and clear' on the hostage room's corridor door without the
//                  menu: whoever is free runs to the stack, the lead boots it, the can goes in, they follow it — the door tools' own order, its can out of the
//                  same three ('open and clear' with none left, or with RESCUE.stun off). The men are the menu's throughout: any order takes a man off it at
//                  any moment (nothing is 'committed'). With the clock not yet running (quiet start) F is two words: the first stacks them and they hold, the
//                  second sends them in.
//   THE FLOW       once the clock runs the pair do not only follow: the last man in the file COVERS each opening Sam passes, unasked, says so, and catches up;
//                  the floor across each opening shows what is known of it (rescueflow.ts — RescueFlow, `flow`; RESCUE.flow / .marks).
//   TWO DOORS      F with a man Sam has posted in the server room (hold / move there / cover / stack up), or pressed from in there with both men on him: that
//                  man takes the SIDE door, the other the corridor door, as two of the door tools' orders through one GATE (doortools.ts DoorGate): neither
//                  door is opened until both are stacked, then the side door's shove waits for the corridor door's boot and the leaves move on one frame; each
//                  man throws his own can and goes in on his own count behind it. A man Sam has put on a 'cover' of his own stays on it: F is a man short.
//                  (The side door's jambs on the server room's side have no floor: the scenario authors that face's marks — SIDE_MARKS, through orders.ts
//                  doorMarks — so the menu's stack up and every door tool work on it from in there too.)
//   THE END        SECURED = nobody of theirs alive in the office, one of the team in it, a hostage alive; held holdSecs → RESCUED: CLEAN with both hostages
//                  alive, COSTLY with one (team up and seconds from the clock's start on the line). LOST (FAILED) = both hostages dead, one hit by Sam's own
//                  round, or Sam down (the game's own down card follows). A restart of any kind stages it again.
//
// Nothing here runs unless start() was called: tick() returns on its first line, and with the scenario off the game is the game as it was.
