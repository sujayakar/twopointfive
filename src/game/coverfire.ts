// AIMED FIRE CHEWS COVER (the destruction goal's AI piece; record rebuild/destruction/ai-fire.md). A shooter of either side who KNOWS a man is
// behind a breakable thing — a crate, a carton stack, a fabric partition, a thin drywall wall — puts his aimed rounds into it, on one spot, until it gives: a
// cover cell at a time, a partition column to a port. Then the fight is the fight again: he sees the man or he does not.
//   KNOWS     his own knowledge and nobody else's truth: where he last really SAW the man (the fight AI's sighting / the room fight's meter, copied here the
//             frame it happens: coverfireTick), `staleSecs` old at most — or a mate of his side within `callM` who has eyes on that man now (`callSecs`: a
//             call is good for the crate a man is behind, never for a wall into a room this man has not seen him in). Never the man's position read off the
//             game. A place heard is not a place known: only sightings are kept.
//   WHAT      the engine is asked what the line from his gun to that place meets (col.raycast → walls.breakableAt → walls.workLeft): the first thing in it must
//             be a breakable the engine indexed, the man's place within `behindM` beyond its face, nothing but more breakable between it and him, at most
//             `maxLayers` pieces deep and `maxRounds` of this gun's rounds in all. Concrete, metal, a door leaf, glass, loose furniture, anything unindexed, or
//             a wall with nobody known behind it: no round. The place asked about is where he was seen; for a man seen MOVING, also a stride or two on the
//             way he was going (`leadM`, `leadSecs`: he went behind it); and when the line to where he stood is CLEAR yet shows no man, a point `lowY` off the
//             floor there (he ducked).
//   HOW       the same gun, cadence, magazine, reload beat, hands and settle law as any other round of his (his side's skill row: a defender lays slower and
//             wider than a teammate, by the rows that already say so). The aim point is held on one spot while the place he knows stays within `sameM` of it,
//             so the engine's counts add up on one cell. Rounds stop at what they hit, as ever.
//   STOPS     the piece gives (the change feed: his count starts again on what stands behind, if anything) · the knowledge goes stale · he has put
//             `slackK` × what it wanted + `slack` rounds into it and it stands (given up for `giveSecs`) · a friend, a hostage or a civilian is in the lane or
//             beyond it as far as a round that got through would fly (`lane`, `pastM`) · the silent order holds his round · and a FREE man does not start at
//             all when walking round is quicker than shooting through (`roundSecs` a round against the nav path at `walkPace`) — a man on a post or under an
//             order has no feet of his own to weigh.
// THE SWITCH is COVERFIRE.on, and it only ever runs under the destruction goal's own (wallBreakOn: DESTRUCTION.on, tune.wallBreak, chaos > 0). Off = every
// hook returns on its first line: no state, no dice, no round (play-through digests equal the base's). The page: on unless the URL carries ?nocoverfire.
// WITH ROUNDS GOING THROUGH THIN THINGS (wallpen.ts, WALLPEN.on and its `men` row; off = everything above, to the round): the line is first asked as the
// ROUND flies it — a partition, a screen, a wooden door leaf this gun's round crosses with a man known behind it gets a short burst THROUGH it ('thru': at
// most WALLPEN.thruRounds on one sighting, booked as `thru` / `thruShots`, never as a chew), with or without the destruction goal's switch; what the round does
// not cross is chewed as above. So where both are live a partition is fired through, not opened — it still opens under the rounds that cross it, by the
// engine's own count.
// Not here: what the man behind the cover then does, charges, glass.
