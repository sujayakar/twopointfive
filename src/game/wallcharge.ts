// WALL CHARGE (Game.wallCharge) — the door charge's TWIN on a partition wall: the same tool, the same count (doortools.ts DoorTools.charges), the same trigger
// (DOORTOOLS.blowKey, F) and the same rule for the men near its far side, set on a wall the destruction engine can open (wallbreak.ts: a thin interior
// partition) instead of on a leaf. It is the first thing in play that calls the engine's blast entry point (destruction.ts Destruction.blast).
//
//   THE SQUAD   the order menu (orders.ts — X or the middle button) opened with the cursor ON A WALL is the floor's menu with its fifth row turned to
//               'wall tools ▸'; on that page row 3 is 'breach with a charge · N left' — X, 5, 3: the three presses that put a charge on a door
//               (WALLCHARGE.menu 'direct' puts the row straight on 5 instead). One man sets it (DOORTOOLS.setSecs at the wall), the rest stand off along the
//               wall out of the blast (WALLCHARGE.standoff metres from it, else back across the floor), and then NOTHING happens until Sam's own trigger:
//               F, or the same row — it reads 'blow the charge' while one is set there. On the trigger the charge calls g.destr.blast against the wall (a
//               hole a man walks through: WALLS.blast.minHole columns), the report / flash / scorch are the stun charge's (combat.ts detonateStun with
//               nobody on its list), the men near the far side are knocked down (inside DOORTOOLS.knockM) or flash-blind and staggered (out to stunM, in
//               its open view) by the door charge's own numbers, and the squad goes in THROUGH THE HOLE — each man to the hole's far mouth, then to a
//               point of his own inside, gun and light up, searching — and the order ends as every entry ends: the men holding the room.
//   SAM ALONE   the same thing by hand, with the rows he uses at a door: with the cursor on a partition and Sam at its foot the Space list offers
//               'breach with a charge · N left' (player.ts buildInteractables → wallChargeRows); he stands on it DOORTOOLS.setSecs (a step breaks it
//               off, nothing spent), and F blows it. No entry follows: there is nobody to send.
//   REFUSED IN WORDS, as the door's are (said by a man, the row greyed with the reason): "concrete. a charge won't cut it." · "steel. a charge won't cut
//               it." · "outer wall. a charge won't cut it." · "it's open." · 'no charges left.' · 'already on it.' · 'no room at that wall.' · 'no floor
//               behind it.' · 'no room to stand off.' · '<callsign> is behind that wall.' / '<callsign> is too close to that wall.' · "can't get there."
//   OUTER WALLS (WALLCHARGE.outer — the maintainer, 10-10: "they pretty much only make sense on exterior walls, where they're currently not allowed … we should allow them
//               exterior too"): a building's outer wall — structure up to `outerThick`, not steel, the open sky over one face of it and a roof over the other (the
//               level's own geometry: outerWall below) — and, `outerYard`, a yard wall with the sky over both takes a charge like a partition, from either face:
//               the same rows, the same stand-off, the same trigger, the same entry through the hole. The engine takes that wall on as a HARD wall on the frame the
//               charge goes (wallbreak.ts adopt + BlastOpts.breach): the hole is the charge's alone — rounds, frags and every other blast leave it the structure it
//               was. Inside the building concrete is still concrete: refused in the same words as ever. Off (the table's own value; the page turns it on,
//               ?noouterwall = off): every outer wall is refused as it always was and nothing here is asked.
//   THE SAFETY RADIUS (WALLCHARGE.safe — the maintainer, 10-10: "the minimum safety radius for the wall charge needs to be larger, especially when indoors!"): two
//               numbers at the charge's place, both larger than the door charge's and larger again where the charge's OWN side is indoors (a roof over the
//               floor at its foot — the level's geometry, chargeIndoors below: the blast has nowhere to go; outdoors it vents). The STAND-OFF the squad takes
//               before it is blown (safeStandoff: 4 m outdoors, 6 m indoors, where it was 2.6) — along the wall, back across the floor, or anywhere near with
//               something solid between it and the charge (round a corner, out of the room); where the floor has no such place they stand off as they
//               always did and the man who calls it says so. And the REACH inside which the blast punishes whoever is on the charge's side with a line to it
//               (safeReach: 3 m outdoors, 5 m indoors, where it was the door charge's 1.6): a teammate is flash-blind longer the nearer he stood, and SAM is
//               rocked — thrown off his feet's line, no round or throw for a beat, his aim opened wide (samCaught). Never hit points. The row and the note
//               that offer the trigger name who is inside it. Off (the table's own value; the page turns it on, ?wallsafe=0 = off): the radii as they were.
//
// THE SWITCH is this module's own: WALLCHARGE.on — and it only ever runs under the destruction goal's (wallBreakOn: destructionSwitch.ts DESTRUCTION.on, the
// walls' own tune.wallBreak, never under a show) at chaos > 0. Off — either of them — the rows are not registered, no target carries a wall, Sam's list has
// no wall row, input() and tick() return on their first line: the build is its base. Nothing here draws from Math.random.

// tools' and tick() after theirs, Interactable's kind 'wall' and Verb 'charge'; player.ts buildInteractables (wallChargeRows) and INTERACT_PRIORITY.wall.
// NOT here: a charge on a door (doortools.ts, and the doors goal's own blast), the frag (the gear goal), what either side makes of a hole afterwards.
// Restart / a checkpoint's load: a new Player or a new cast is a fresh run — nothing set, nothing under way (sync); the wall itself is the engine's to put
// back. A set charge is not saved.
