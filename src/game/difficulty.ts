// THE DIFFICULTY SWITCH for the loud squad scenarios: ONE row (Tab ▸ Sandbox ▸ Difficulty, the start card, ?hard / ?difficulty=) over the two tables that hold
// the harder defenders — pressure.ts (press · flank · fall back) and digin.ts (far rooms get ready). It owns no behaviour, and no state of its own but the levers moved by hand (THE LEVERS, below):
//   STANDARD (shipped) = both tables at their build values, both switches off: the room fight exactly as it was before either file existed, run for run.
//   HARD               = both tables at their build values with both switches ON and the rows of the `HARD` table below written over them, joined by REACH (`HARD.reachM`): a defender whose way on foot to the fight he
//                        hears is shorter than that is the press's (he comes, with the others, round by a second door); a man farther off holds his room and
//                        digs in. What the join adds beside the two files (all inside them, each one clause): the press never takes a man the reach rule holds
//                        (pressure.ts consider), a man on his beat toward a press does not start on his room (digin.ts think), a man SET on his door does not
//                        give his room up at boots outside it (pressure.ts lastMan · DIGIN.holdSet), and a man who gives ground falls back INTO a dug-in room
//                        when his side has one (pressure.ts hooked → digin.ts digInRefuge).
//                        And one row of its own (`HARD.keeperDigs`, off): the man a press leaves to keep his room does NOT dig in — so at reach 0 hard is
//                        the press with almost no barricades (a man digs in only on a noise the press finds nothing in to go to).
//                        The table's other rows are rules of the press, each one switch from b8ffda2's hard: stand to (a team heard before its
//                        first entry), stand and fight (a team that goes straight on), far rooms by one door (the depot). What each measures:
//                        rebuild/hard-everywhere/numbers.md.
// What is kept per machine is the LEVEL'S NAME (`twopointsix.difficulty`), not a copy of the rows: a machine on hard takes the build's hard at every boot, so a
// later build that retunes a row or the reach carries it. The row shown is READ OFF the tables (`difficultyNow`): both switches off = standard whatever the rows
// under them say (nothing in either file runs); both on at the build's hard rows = hard; anything else = custom — a row under the switch moved by hand, which
// drops the stored name and keeps the two tables through their own stores instead (`difficultyCustom`, the Tab rows' save). Nothing here touches hit points,
// aim, reaction tables or dice.
//
//
// THE LEVERS (the maintainer, 10-10: 'let's actually unbundle difficulty a bit now since i think we'll need some play testing' · 'so fog of war has three rungs'
// · 'can have other levers for enemy ai and kit etc.'): what the level's name wrote as one bundle is three LEVERS, each set on its own before a mission
// (ui/levers.ts: the mission sheet and the loadout screen) — `fog` (team all round · team in cones · your own eyes), `ai` (the defenders standard · hard: every
// rule of theirs above) and `kit` (what they carry: nothing · a stun charge each). STANDARD and HARD are the two settings of all three the build was measured
// at (`presetLevers`): a level's name is a shortcut that puts every lever on its rung, and with no lever moved off it this file is what it was, run for run.
// A lever moved by hand (`setLever`) is kept on this machine (`twopointsix.levers`) and stands OVER whichever level a page starts at — the kept name, a
// `difficulty=` on the URL, a short-list row's own — until a level is picked again (the sheet's Standard | Hard: every lever back on that level's rung);
// `?fog=team|cones|own`, `?enemyai=standard|hard`, `?enemykit=none|stuns` are the same for a visit, over the kept ones. The rows shown are READ OFF the
// tables like the name (`leversShown`). No lever touches hit points, aim, reaction tables or dice either.
//
// IMPORT CYCLE (src/game is one): nothing at module level uses another game module's exports.
