// DOORWAY MANNERS: how a man on foot shares a doorway with his own side. The maintainer, 10-08: "doors could use some work too … AI does a better job not
// crowding". Measured on the build before this file (tools/qa/door-watch.ts over the loud levels): every man plans his walk as if he were alone (guards.ts goTo)
// and the only thing between two of one side is the push that parts their bodies at 0.6 m (collideGuard) — so a file told to fall in or to stack went through a
// frame two abreast and shoving, a follower stopped 'near enough' in the leaf's swing or on top of the man beside him, and a defender who got his line from a
// threshold planted on it and fought from there with a colleague behind him wanting through. Three rules, for the squad (team 'operative') and the defenders
// (team 'hostile') alike, all from where the men ARE and where they are walking — nothing scripted, no new order, nobody runs:
//   PASS  (doorwayGate, the first thing followPath / the scripted strafe ask): a man whose walk goes through a frame within `reach` looks at his own side about
//         it. A friend going his way ahead of him is followed at `gap` (pace eased from `gap` down to nothing at `gapMin`: one in the opening at a time, nobody
//         pushed through; a friend standing on his line by a door, his own way on past him, is walked ROUND — a corner put in his walk beside the man —
//         and one standing where his own place is, is stopped short of). A friend STANDING in the opening, standing just beyond it, or coming the other way and nearer the frame than he is, holds him short
//         of it (`throat`) — and held more than `aside` seconds he steps to a place off a jamb on his own face (`jambOut` off the wall, `jambPast` past the
//         jamb, a `fileGap` between places, clear of the leaf's swing and of everybody), turned to the door, and goes when it is free. A man IN an opening is
//         never held: he clears it. Nobody waits for ever: `patience` seconds held and he goes anyway (the old shove), with `rest` seconds before he can be
//         held again — under every caller's own stall clock, so a held man is never called stuck or planted 'going nowhere' for it.
//   STAND (doorwayStand, asked by orders.ts for a place in the file): no place in the file is in a frame's strip or where a leaf swings, shut or open, and a
//         follower who has stopped 'near enough' on top of the man ahead of him walks on to his own place. (The swing costs length: places slide back
//         along the trail past the arc, so by a door the file stands a metre or two longer behind Sam — `swing` off keeps the strip only. Stepping the
//         place sideways out of the arc instead was tried: its men were off the trail when Sam walked on and fell further behind.)
//   FIGHT (offThreshold, asked by the fight AI where it would plant and fire): planted in an open doorway `funnel` seconds, he steps off the opening — the
//         squad through it to the side its man is on, a defender back off it on his own side — to a spot that still has the shot, instead of fighting from the frame.
//   STAND, THE LANE (doorwayLane; the squad only): doors stand open now (doors.ts DOORSTAY), and a door standing open is a line of fire from whoever is
//         beyond it. So no place in the file is in the lane of one either (`lane`: stepped square off it), the walk an order gives a man to a mark goes
//         round such a lane where there is a way round that takes no other door (`laneWalk`, orders.ts route), and on the walk to a stack the rear man's gun
//         is on a door standing open by the way (`watch`, cover.ts). Measured on the two squad maps where the door build lost men:
//         rebuild/doors/first-door/notes.md in the project files.
// DOORMANNERS.on off = none of it runs: the build as it was, digest for digest (each rule has its own switch under it for an A/B). The night shift's staff (team
// 'guard') are left as they were — the stealth game's frozen runs hold whatever the switch says.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
