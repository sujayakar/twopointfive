// A ROOM'S LIGHTS HAVE A SWITCH ON THE WALL (the maintainer, 10-19: "one obvious thing: we should have light switches for rooms!" — and "probably don't want
// to go TOO ham on this but it should feel good").
//
// The fixtures were always switchable (LightTarget.on; lighting.ts updateTargets writes the light, its glow card and its markings off it, and the CPU's light
// estimate, the meter, the men's eyes and the picture all read that one list): what the game lacked was a thing on the wall a hand could reach. On:
//
//   where     a plate beside a door of every room that has mains lights of its own, on the room's own face of the wall, past the latch jamb (the side the
//             leaf does not swing over), at hand height — found from the level as it stands (the doors, cleared.ts's rooms, a ray to the wall): no level file
//             says where, so every level has them and none had to be edited. Where the door's own wall gives no place (a glass front, a corner) it hangs on
//             the room's nearest plain wall. A room is the floor cleared.ts floods from a door; its lights are the mains fixtures that hang in it — every
//             analytic light, and the flat ceiling panels and tubes (a screen, a sign and a vending front are not the room's lights and stay lit; a lantern,
//             a stove and a street lamp are not on the mains and have no switch). A room lit in several circuits (the fixtures' authored groups: an open
//             floor's corridor and its desks) has a plate for each circuit a plate hangs nearest. At most `perRoom` plates a circuit, at the doors furthest
//             apart. A room too big to be a room (open floor) has none.
//   the hand  one row on Space within `reach` of the plate with a line to it: 'lights off' / 'lights on'. It ranks UNDER a door's rows (a door is used a
//             hundred times for every switch: beside a door the tap is the door's, and the plate hangs `beside` m off the jamb so that standing at it the
//             door is out of reach and the tap is the switch's). The flip is on the tap: a click, the room dark on the frame; put back on, the tubes strike
//             as they do when the mains come back (`strike`), a bulb is simply on. Sam's hand goes to the plate for `handSecs` (the picture only — and, with
//             handring.ts `turn`, a short plant: he is stood at the plate and squared to it for the hand's move, see switchHand).
//   put back  ON = the room as it was authored (the panels the level left dark stay dark); a room authored wholly dark gets all of them.
//   the men   a light put out at its switch is SEEN like any light going out (a 'lightOut' event a man's eye needs a line to: guards.ts lightOutSeen) and it
//             says where the hand was: a calm defender who saw it comes to the SWITCH, not to the patch of floor (`GameEvent.swAt`). A calm defender who
//             stands at the switch of a room the LEVEL had lit and a hand put out puts it back, `guardSecs` after the hand at the soonest (`guards`; never in
//             a fight, blind, asleep or scripted, never a teammate or a civilian, never under a blackout — the breaker is its own errand — and never a room
//             the level left dark: Sam's own 'on' then 'off' there is nobody's to undo). The click itself is not a sound the hearing model carries.
//
// State: when a hand put a fixture out (LightTarget.handOff, a game time — beside `on`, saved with it: savestate.ts TargetSnap.hand, written only when set;
// 'lights on' puts back what the hand put out). The plates are a memo of the level as it stands when first asked (made again after a restart or a load); a
// plate whose wall is blown goes with the wall, and is back with it on a load (asked after when the level's geometry serial moves). No dice.
//
// Not here: a teammate sent to a switch on an order (workthings.ts lists the things a teammate works; a switch is not yet one), a defender who turns the
// lights on in a room the level left dark, a man posted on a mark leaving it for the switch, a switch for lamps on posts. In the fog of war a plate is drawn
// like a keypad (always), so its pilot shows a dark room's switch the team cannot see.
//
// ON in the page (`?lightswitch=0` = as it was), OFF in the module and on the frozen harness stand (`TPS_LIGHTSWITCH=1`): a FROZEN_HOLDS row, in the knob
// registry and a journal's tables; a recording from before the table replays with it off.
