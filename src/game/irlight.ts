// AN IR LIGHT ON THE GOGGLES (the maintainer, 10-15, of a depot whose rooms were flat black noise through the tube: "maybe we should model IR lights on the nvg
// so even totally dark rooms are visible. and we can assume enemies never have nvg"). A tube amplifies, it does not invent (nvg.ts): a room with no light of its
// own showed nothing through it. So the goggles carry what real ones carry — an infrared illuminator: a flood of light only a tube sees by.
//
//   WHO CARRIES ONE, AND WHEN IT BURNS. Sam, on the frames whose picture is the tube's (Player.nvAmount past 0.5, post.wgsl's own swap: it comes up with the
//     picture and goes with it — no bare-eyed frame has it) and, under IRLIGHT.auto below, only where his place is too dark for the tube. On his knee at a
//     door with the wand under it (wand.ts WAND.nv) the flood is the lens's. A teammate (IRLIGHT.team; a man of nvg.ts: an operative unit of a scenario
//     whose card left him his goggles), whenever HIS are down (nvg.ts nvgDown). No key, no order: it is part of the goggles. Nobody else — an enemy has no night
//     vision and no infrared anything.
//   ONLY WHERE IT IS TOO DARK (IRLIGHT.auto; the maintainer, 10-16, of a moonlit lot under five floods: "IR lights are a bit too bright. is it realistic to
//     only have them turn on when it's actually too dark to see?" — it is: a tube works on the light that is there first, and the illuminator is for where
//     there is none). Each carrier reads his own place: the floor under him, and four times a second a fan of floor across the flood's own width as far as
//     the first wall each way (fanDark) — the place's own light there (nvg.ts nvgPlaceLight: the fixtures and the moon, nothing anybody carries, nothing
//     infrared) taken through the tube (tubeVis). Any of it under NVG.blackAt — the line nvg.ts already calls 'too dark for the tube' — and his light burns,
//     from that reading until IRLIGHT.hold seconds after the last dark one (a look swept past a dark doorway does not blink it), then eases out.
//     Everywhere the tube shows the place by its own light the illuminator is out: a moonlit yard, a lit corridor. Off = it burns whenever the goggles are
//     down, as it did.
//   BY THE LIGHT THE PICTURE HAS (IRLIGHT.meter; the maintainer, 10-18, of a strongroom with its bulb off, its floor under his flood and the room round it
//     plain in the goggles: "still feels like the IR light here is unnecessary"). The estimate above is the CPU's: direct light only. A room with no lamp
//     of its own is 0 to it, and yet the tube — which makes a picture of a thousandth of a lit room's light — shows that room by what comes round the door
//     frame and off the walls. The renderer's light meter has that bounce (probe.wgsl: shadowed direct light + the radiance cache) and is given nothing by
//     an infrared light, so it still cannot answer its own question. So the CPU's rule stays the FIRST word — where it calls a place light nothing more is
//     asked — and the renderer gets the LAST one on what the CPU calls dark: the floor under him (Sam's and a teammate's own meters, asked every frame as
//     it is; the wand's lens asks its own) and a spread of up to IRL_METER.slots of the dark points his fan found, asked through the sensors' seam
//     (Game.lightQuery) on his beat and read every frame. A point is dark when the PICTURE of it is under IRLIGHT.show of the tube's range: the CPU's
//     direct light + the meter's bounce × settings.indirectScale (the meter's bounce is physical; the picture's is scaled — fgather.wgsl) through the
//     tube's curve (nvg.ts tubeSig). A line of its own, and higher than NVG.blackAt: that one is where a MAN is lost to a goggled eye, about 0.035 of
//     the range, and direct light is either well over it or nothing; bounce is every value between, and floor at 0.05 of the range is grain to the
//     player (the strongroom with its door shut, on the software adapter). Under this branch the CPU's first word is asked by the same line. The same
//     count decides: the floor under him, or FAN_NEED of the points. A point not yet answered waits IRL_METER.wait (no light: a light that came on by
//     the CPU's word and went out by the renderer's two frames on would blink for its whole hold every time the goggles came down in such a room), then
//     takes the CPU's word. Where no renderer answers at all — headless, the senses on the CPU (sense.ts), a page before its first frame: Sam's own
//     meter has no answer — the CPU's rule is the whole rule, at once, exactly as it was. So his light burns in a room that is sealed and unlit, and
//     not in one the picture already shows. Off = the CPU's estimate decides everywhere, as it did.
//   WHAT IT IS. A real light: a wide spot at his brow along the way he faces, tipped a little to the floor, shadowed by every wall, leaf and body like any other.
//     Its strength is said as what the TUBE makes of it (IRLIGHT.power: on-axis intensity × the picture's exposure — the tube counts exposed luminance, so the
//     flood reads the same through it at every hour and on every Brightness setting), not as a wattage.
//   WHO SEES BY IT. Only a tube. The lights are kept in a list of their own (render/lights.ts LightSet.ir), never in the list every other reader sums, and are
//     handed to the renderer flagged infrared: uploaded only on a frame whose picture IS the tube's, where each is a steady light like a torch (the frame
//     the tube comes off, the engine restarts every screen history: engine.ts), and given NOTHING by
//     the light meter (probe.wgsl → common.wgsl evalLightTrue) or the cascades its bounce comes from. So an enemy's eye, a camera's lens, Sam's own light meter
//     and every CPU light estimate read the room as it is without them — dark — by construction: the HUD's LIGHT bar stays where it was while the room shows.
//     A TEAMMATE'S TUBE reads them (IRLIGHT.team; nvg.ts nvgSight asks irOnMan for the man he looks at): a man standing in an illuminator's flood is lit to a
//     goggled eye and to no other. And a man who carries one is never 'too dark for the tube' (nvg.ts readPlace's `black`: the white-light fallback that file
//     kept for a room with no light at all retires — his goggles now show him the way everywhere he can face: under IRLIGHT.auto his light comes on for
//     the dark floor his fan finds, which reaches past everything readPlace asks along his gun).
//
// IRLIGHT.on false = no such light anywhere: the picture and the run of the build before this file. IRLIGHT.team false = Sam's alone, in the picture alone —
// nothing in the simulation reads it, so the run is the one before this file, digest for digest (tools/qa/irlight-probes.ts holds both).
// Nothing is saved: the list is made again every frame from who has his goggles down, and a carrier's reading of his place (IRLIGHT.auto: when it last read
// dark, how far his light has eased) is kept per Game and starts again after a load — a light inside its hold at the save is out or full at once. UNTUNED BY EYE: nothing here was seen on a GPU.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
