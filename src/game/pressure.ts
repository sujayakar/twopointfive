// Defenders that PRESS a room their side has lost, come ROUND through a second door of it, and FALL BACK to fight again — the loud squad scenarios' harder
// defenders, each behaviour behind its own switch and the whole of it behind `PRESSURE.on` (default OFF: nothing here runs, no die is drawn, and the room fight is
// roomfight.ts exactly as it was — its three seams are `pressOwns` at the head of rally(), `pressTick` at the tail of tick() and `pressStop` in stop()).
//
// Nothing here is more hit points, a faster trigger, a truer aim or a die on the outcome. It is the SAME men with the SAME senses doing something less dumb with
// what they hear, and each thing they do says so first — one model for the picture and the AI: a call is `g.say` on their radio net (the '<callsign> (radio):'
// line in the log, the way tactics.ts's alert men already tell each other 'moving round' / 'set' — what a man knows of a press beyond his own ears is what went
// over that net), boots are 'step' hearing events the teammates' own ears take (roomfight.ts stepEars), a door is the door.
//
//  PRESS (PRESSURE.press). Today a defender who hears a fight at a mate's post goes to it only if the noise is still fresh when his beat is up, and then three
//    times in four (roomfight.ts rally): a room that falls in a second draws nobody, and its neighbours wait in theirs to be cleared in turn. With the switch
//    on, a fight at a post of his side's in another room is a thing he ACTS on for `memorySecs` after he heard it: after the same beat of his own (FIGHT_SKILL
//    rally) he calls it ('they've hit the others — get in there!' / 'with you — moving!') and goes at it, the fight AI's man exactly as the stock rally's is.
//    Who goes is situation, not dice: a lone garrison goes, a room of several leaves its farthest man at home, at most `maxMen` to a press. A man this file
//    does not take is the stock rally's as before (`pressOwns`): the hook never leaves a man standing who would have gone.
//    `gather` (off) is the other way to press, kept for A/B: they RUN to spots outside that room's doors, off their lines, hold them from outside ('hold the
//    doors — let them come to us!') until a fight inside, the trap sprung at one door (`converge`) or `siegeSecs`, and go together on a word ('go — go — go!').
//    One man by himself never goes in on that road: he holds the door from outside and says so. Measured: a formed-up push into a room four rifles hold LOSES
//    (the team keeps more men than today); going at once, while the entry is still on, is what costs the team.
//  FLANK (PRESSURE.flank). The second and later men of a press look at the door their shortest way goes through: if a man of the press has it already and
//    another door of that room is not absurdly far round (≤ flankMaxM, ≤ max(flankK × his shortest way, shortest + flankSlackM)), he takes that one — 'going
//    round — keep them there!', a run on a path that does not cross the room, his boots filed for the team's ears, then 'in position — on them!' and in. So
//    the press arrives at two doors, and the door the team did not watch is the one it comes through.
//  FALL BACK (PRESSURE.fallBack). (a) A man of a press who can see enough of it down (his own nerve, the stock fall-back's number — or every other man of it
//    lies where he can see him) with the enemy on him goes BACK out to a spot outside the door he came by and holds that door from there: 'back — get back!
//    hold the door!'. (b) The last man up in a room, with two or more of the team in his own sight, does not die at his post: after his own beat he leaves by
//    a door the trouble is not at, plants beyond it watching it, and tells whoever of his side holds the room he has come into ('they're right behind me —
//    watch that door!' — their evidence for that door goes up). (c) `outEarly`: he does not have to see them — on a floor gone loud, the team's boots at one
//    door of his room send him out by another before the door goes. WHERE a man falls back to is one seam (`PRESSURE_HOOKS.fallBackTo`) another module may
//    answer — a room his side has dug in. The stock fall-back (roomfight.ts lost → breakOff) is untouched and still runs first. Men somebody else has pinned
//    to their room (the rescue's men with the hostages: rallyAt Infinity / lostAt ahead of the clock) and a man in Sam's arm are never this file's.
//  STAND AND FIGHT (PRESSURE.second — off in the build, ON under the difficulty switch's hard). A team that does not wait in the room it took is met in the
//    open, on its way to the next door, by the men the press sent at that room — and a man who walks on at four rifles while he shoots loses. With this on, a
//    hunter the press called who gets his eyes on one of them OUT of the room he was called to (and is out of it himself) stops where he stands and fights
//    from there, the room fight's holder again: a set gun, the first of them calling it on their net ('contact — they're out in the open! stand and
//    fight!'). A team still in the room is pressed exactly as before. Off = they walk on at you one by one, as they did.
//
// What the counts mean (`pressureStats`, tools/qa/playthrough.ts files them per run): a behaviour FIRED when a man acted on it; its cue is the call at that
// moment; it LANDED when that man first had eyes on an enemy or an enemy on him; `lead` = seconds from HIS call to that (summed; ≥ 1 s = the cue came first);
// `heard` = a teammate's own ears had that man's boots (roomfight.ts Op.stepBy) before he landed.
