// A MAN'S CONDITION — the one place that says what state a man is in, whoever he is: the player, one of his men, a defender. The states are the ones the
// game already had in pieces (shaken: fire on him, suppression.ts · blind: `dazzledUntil` · folded: `staggerUntil` · down: one round, or a blast close to) and
// one it did not: HURT. A blast that reaches a man and leaves him standing leaves him hurt, and from then on he is never faster than a walk and his rounds go
// wider. That is all of it: a condition only ever takes something from a man. Nobody has a second round in him because of it — how a man goes down is not
// touched here, and there is no count of anything.
//
// One cost for all three, each charged where that man's speed and spread are already settled:
//   pace     an AI man wherever his legs are asked for a speed: teamPace (guards.ts: every path he walks), stepAlongPath and the room entry's stepGate
//            (tactics.ts), which take their speed straight, and the two planners that pick where a man can run to from a grenade (frag.ts, squadthrow.ts:
//            the corner is one HIS legs make) · the player loses his sprint (player.ts: Shift is not a run for him, so it stops no reload either)
//   spread   as if fire were on him at `hurtSup`: conditionSup, which the three readers of a man's suppression for his rounds ask (suppression.ts
//            guardFireMods and samSpread; the room fight's and the covering man's own line). The larger of that and the fire really on him, never a sum;
//            how fast he fires is not touched. It rides suppression's own switch: with `tune.suppression` off nobody's rounds open, a hurt man's included.
// Only a burst (frag.ts blast: a frag, a 40 mm, the bomb a defuse lost) leaves a man hurt. A door or wall charge and the player's own charge fold a man
// and blind him as they did and leave him sound.
// What a man looks like in each state is the poses' to say (character.ts mvPost / mvArms: the fold of a man knocked about, the hunch and short step of a
// hurt one, the tucked head of one under fire), dealt by conditionPose every frame for all three alike. A showcase's cast is left as it was written.
//
// CONDITION.on: OFF here and on the frozen stand (TPS_CONDITION=1 raises it), ON in the page (?nocondition). Off = no man is ever hurt and every reader below
// answers as the build did before it. tools/qa/condition-check.ts (probes.ts condition; CONDITION_BREAK=1).
