// HOW MUCH YOU'RE TOLD — the fourth difficulty lever (difficulty.ts LEVERS are fog of war, enemy AI, enemy kit), and the fog lever's bottom rung on a squad mission.
//
// The maintainer, 10-23: "how do we communicate friendly and enemy AI state to the player (especially on easier difficulties)". Every setting the game had
// only took signs away (the fog's cones, own eyes). This lever is the other way round: EASIER BY CLEARER, never by hit points. Three rungs, from the
// easiest: GUIDED · STANDARD · BARE. Standard is the level standard, Bare is hard's; Guided is no level's — it is reached by moving the lever.
//
// WHAT A RUNG DOES TODAY: one thing, the last-seen mark (fogofwar.ts lastSeen, the '(?)' ui/overlay.ts already draws for FOG.lastSeen and for the wand).
// An enemy who goes out of the team's sight keeps a fading mark on the spot he was last seen at for `TOLD.standard` seconds on Standard, `TOLD.guided` on
// Guided, and none on Bare (FOG.lastSeen, the debugger's row, is 0 as shipped: turned up it is the seconds on every rung). The mark is the HUD's alone:
// nothing in the game reads it, so a run is the same run on every rung, digest for digest. It is drawn only under a fog; the lever's row stays live with the
// fog's own (its off rung included), because the lever is for more signs than this one.
//
// A LATER RULE ASKS THE LEVER, never the difficulty: `toldNow()` is the rung in force and `toldAtLeast('standard')` / `toldAtLeast('guided')` is 'this sign
// is shown here'. With the switch off both answer as Bare: the build as it was, nothing more told than it ever told.
//
// WHERE THE RUNG LIVES: `TOLD.rung`, a row of this table, written by difficulty.ts with the other levers (the rung of the level the other three stand on — so
// hard's three rungs set by hand are Hard, Bare with them — or the one moved by hand:
// kept per machine with the others, `?told=guided|standard|bare` for a visit), so a recording's tables carry it.
//
// THE FOG OFF ON A SQUAD MISSION (`TOLD.fogOff`): the quiet missions' fog lever has a bottom rung, off (quietfog.ts); with this up a squad mission's fog
// lever has it too — every enemy drawn. No fog is no fog for the squad's own code as well (fogofwar.ts sighting / hidden answer for every enemy, so a charge
// spot, a pair's foe list and the 40 mm count men nobody has seen), and the rung's words say so: it is the cheap test, the floor under Guided, not Guided.
// The rung is the squad lever's (difficulty.ts SET.fog 'off', kept with the levers, `?fog=off` for a visit); scenarioRun.ts fogOfQuery reads it where a
// mission starts, unless the link asks for the fog by name (`fow`).
//
// THE SWITCHES: `TOLD.on` (the lever) and `TOLD.fogOff` (the rung) — both ON in the page (`?told=0`, `?fogoff=0`), OFF here and on the frozen harness
// stand (`TPS_TOLD=1`, `TPS_FOGOFF=1`). Off is the build as it was: three levers, three rungs of fog, FOG.lastSeen alone deciding the mark. A recording
// from before the keys replays with both off (journal.ts).
