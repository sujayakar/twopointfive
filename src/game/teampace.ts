// TEAMMATES ARE SLOWER THAN THE PLAYER, AND SPRINT ONLY FOR A REASON (TEAMPACE.on: on in the page, ?teampace=0; off here and on the frozen stand, TPS_TEAMPACE=1).
//
// The play note this answers: the player moves at 1×, a teammate at 0.8× — "when you send them an order and they start moving, you can always catch up
// with them"; "if you sprint to go somewhere … the teammates should also sprint when they're following you"; sprinting is "in their toolbox, but they should
// use it pretty infrequently, like maybe only if they're running to cover" — "it should just generally make sense, because sprinting is actually just very risky".
//
// Before it the team's legs were capped at guards.ts PACE.max (2.2 m/s) whatever was asked, the player walked at 1.55 and ran at 4.7: an ordered team out-walked
// him to every door, and a file left behind by his sprint closed up at 2.2.
//
//   THE WALK     a teammate's legs are asked for no more than `k` × the player's walk (tune.playerWalk) on an order or on his own — guards.ts teamPace's cap,
//                in PACE.max's place, for the same men (teamPaced). His card still weighs on it (kitload.ts), a hurt man's cap and the silent squad's are under it.
//   FOLLOWING    a man falling in who is off his place closes at up to `followK` × the player's walk (teamFollow), so a walking player does not string his
//                file out behind him. While the PLAYER SPRINTS a follower who is `behindM` off his place — and has nobody to fight — runs with him at the
//                player's own sprint, and keeps it until the player stops running (`follow`).
//   THE FIGHT    what the fight asks of his legs is not a walk to a place and keeps the pace it had (PACE.max): a man who has somebody in his sights or lost
//                one `fightSecs` ago; the leg through an ordered door (ORDERS.entry: the stun's seconds are counted on it); a step the
//                room fight orders (off a doorway's opening, round a friend in his line); the breach drill; a man leaving a grenade who may not run;
//                and a man a grenade took off his place, for `backSecs` after it (a door order waits for its men, and counts the seconds).
//   A REASON     on his own (`own`) a teammate RUNS for one of two things — and for a third when a tutorial step tells him to (`told`: teamTold, at the
//                foot of this file) — each written down as it is taken (TEAMPACE_STATS, TEAMPACE_DEBUG.log):
//                  blast   he is running from a live grenade (frag.ts fragRunning) — at the pace the flee asks, as anybody's legs;
//                  cover   loud has just reached him, he has no man in his sights, the floor he is on is in the line of a man he knows of, his mark is out
//                          of it and in plain sight across `dashM` or more of the same floor: he runs the leg (teamDash) — never round a corner, never
//                          through a doorway, never a man falling in (his place is the player's to move).
//                Never the silent squad, a squad nobody has found, a man sneaking with the player (blast apart: nobody walks off a grenade), never a hurt man.
//   THE COST     a teammate at a run (`runAt`, the sprint clip's own threshold) carries his gun low and fires nothing (teamSprinting: squad.ts, roomfight.ts),
//                his boots are a sprinter's (`step`: the player's own level) to whoever hears them, and a leaf he meets is shouldered as a runner's is.
//
