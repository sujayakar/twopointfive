// WALL WEAR — what a breakable wall or piece of cover SHOWS while it is being shot, before it gives. LOOK ONLY: wallbreak.ts counts a round into a cell and opens
// the cell when the count is up; until then the wall used to stand whole to the eye (a 3 cm bullet mark on the shooter's face, nothing at all on the far one) and
// then burst. Here every counted round's mark is sized by how far gone its cell is — a pock, then a small hole in a ring of blown plaster, then cracks out of it —
// the marks the cell already carries grow with it, and on a thin partition the same mark shows on the FAR face (a blister, then a blow-out) with a puff and chips
// thrown out of that side. Nothing here is geometry: a 'small hole' is paint. Nothing sees, shoots or hears through it; the cell goes when it always went.
//
// THE RULES IT KEEPS (the destruction lane's digests stand):
//   · it READS the cell's count (handed in by WallBreak.round as a fraction) and writes nothing back; no hash counter of the lane's, no rate cap, no debris pool,
//     no solver dust, no light, no sound, no ray;
//   · it adds NO decal: the round's own bullet mark (marks.ts bulletMark, placed by combat.ts just before the destruction lane hears of the round) is EDITED into
//     decal kind 'damage' with param ≥ WEAR_MARK.look (render/decals.ts WEAR_MARK is the contract with decals.wgsl wearMark), so the decal ring's count — which
//     the game digest carries — is what it was. Variation comes off the decal's own look seed. A counted round that laid no mark (a muzzle pressed through the
//     wall — combat.ts wallAcrossArm) shows nothing new and throws nothing: the earlier marks of its cell still grow;
//   · particles only where a GPU system is attached (gpuFx), ≤ WEAR.maxBirths a round;
//   · nothing is saved: the ring already files a mark's kind / radius / strength (savestate.ts), so a load shows the wall as it was; the per-cell lists that let
//     OLD marks grow are dropped on restart / load (marks made before a load stay the size they were).
//
// THROUGH MARKS: on a partition of half thickness WEAR_MARK.minHalf‥maxHalf the record sits on the wall's MID-PLANE with a bounding radius of hypot(half
// thickness, reach) and the shader paints the wall's two faces from it (entry look where the surface faces the record's normal, exit look where it faces away;
// it recovers the half thickness from the radius and the strength, and takes only surfaces ON those two planes — a door leaf shut in the wall's plane is not
// one). Thicker cover, and sheet thinner than minHalf, take the entry look on the face that was hit and nothing behind.
//
// WHICH CELL A MARK BELONGS TO: the cell that was HIT (`key`), sized by the count of the cell the round was COUNTED into (a wall's sill counts on the upper
// while the upper stands). So a sill's marks grow with the port above it, stay as they are when the port opens (marks never shrink), and grow on from there
// once the sill's own count passes them.
