 *  `hammer`: a sledge 0.8 m long, laid out along its handle (z, butt → head) from THE RIGHT FIST'S GRIP — in the hands that is the fist's own frame, the knife's
 *  construction (origin = the middle of the grip: `grip.fwd` along the fingers from the wrist, `grip.palm` out of the palm; z out of the thumb side, x across the
 *  knuckles): the handle through the fist with the head `headAt` beyond it (its middle), the left fist `hands` down the handle toward the butt. The head's long
 *  axis is x: it strikes the way the knuckles lead. `back`: where it rides when it is not in the hands, in the back's own frame (RIG.sc20k.slung's construction:
 *  `off` from the mid-back joint along [his left, up the spine, ahead] to that same grip point, `bore` = the handle's line, butt → head, `roll` ° about it,
 *  `follow` the chest's share of the facing): head up behind the right shoulder — where a right hand over that shoulder finds the handle just under it — the
 *  handle down across the back toward the spine. `shotgun`: carried, it is a long gun's boxes (the carbine's: the M870 has no parts of its own yet) in the
 *  slung rifle's own place across the back; in Sam's hands, off his right hand like any long gun. `clear`: with something else across his back (Sam's slung
 *  rifle) the tool rides this much further off it, so the two do not lie inside each other — a number a tool, measured box against box (bigslot-check, 'over
 *  the rifle'): the shotgun lies along the rifle's own line, a receiver's thickness out; the hammer's head sits where the rifle's stock stands off behind the
 *  right shoulder, and at the shotgun's 7.5 cm lay 2.6 cm inside the bullpup's hull and 1.8 inside the carbine's stock. bigClearOf below is the distance asked
 *  for: this plus whatever the rifle itself rides out on the body that carries it. Outside RIG on purpose, as SLING_FRONT: FIRST-PASS numbers placed
