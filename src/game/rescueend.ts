// HOW A HOSTAGE RESCUE ENDS (RESCUEEND; rescue.ts outcome() asks here while the switch is up). The maintainer, 10-18: "the hostage rescue missions should have
// you safely extract the hostage or fully clear the map."
//
//   WHAT WAS THERE   the room taken and held RESCUE.holdSecs (15 s) was the win: men of theirs alive anywhere else did not matter, and there was nowhere to go.
//   THE RULE         a rescue is WON one of two ways, and by nothing else:
//     OUT       every hostage still alive stands inside `outM` of the WAY OUT — the team's own way in (scenarios.rescue.team.sam: the mark Sam is staged
//               on) — having been led there. A hostage is led by a row on her once nobody of theirs has her (rescue.ts captor() null): Space, 'on your
//               feet — with me': every living hostage gets up and follows whoever said it (civilians.ts hostageLead: the civilians' own legs and the nav
//               grid, a walk that becomes a run when she has fallen behind); the same row then reads 'stay here' and puts them down where they stand.
//     CLEARED   nobody of theirs is left on the floor: every man hostile to the team down, or run off with his gun dropped (runner.ts), for `clearSecs`.
//               A man in Sam's arm is still a man: put him down first.
//   LOST is as it was: every hostage dead, one hit by the team's own round, the player down.
//   THE ROOM taken is still said and logged ('secured'), and the line that said to hold it says what is asked now; it is let go of ('unsecured') only by
//   one of theirs coming back into it while the hostages are still in it.
//
// Off (the module's default, the frozen stand) = the build as it was: nothing here is asked and the 15 s hold ends the run. On in the page (host/profile.ts
// pageSwitches; ?norescueend) and on the shipped stand; TPS_RESCUEEND=1 raises it on a frozen run. UNTUNED by play.
// Per-player state (habit: 'which player, not the player'): the one who gave the word is kept as a character, never read off Game.player after the press.
