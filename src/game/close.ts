// CLOSER THAN EVER — Sam near a man: his own body says what he can do, and the sneak holds its pose when he stops.
//
// The ask, 10-09: "we want the behavior where the animation changes when you enter the mode, the character changes when you're close enough to do a melee
// attack (sam reached for his knife), which makes it very legible when you're close enough to do something, melee attacks work from all angles, grabbing only
// works from behind, and then the sneaking animation is designed so it can be paused frame by frame in this mode (pausing movement sticks in the current
// position, not reverting back to an idle state). then, the exhibit of this is slipping past guards in close proximity in a dark room, "slithering" between
// them". With CLOSE.on (off = every hook below returns on its first line and the game is the game):
//
//   THE MODE  within `modeM` of a living man with nothing solid between, Sam is IN THE MODE (`closeMode`): character.ts `creep` — his carriage changes, and his
//             gait HOLDS: stopping leaves him in the stride he was in, a tap of movement advances it, nothing eases back to the idle. Out again past `modeOutM`.
//   THE TELL  inside melee reach of a man, from any side, his hand goes to the knife on his chest and rests on it (character.ts `ready` + `reachShown`; the
//             knife stays in its sheath — rigProps draws it there — "sam doesn't pull out his knife when he's within melee radius, just reaches for it to
//             telegraph the state change"). Behind him the free arm also reaches for his neck: the grab is on.
//   THE BLOW  is the player's choice (`lethal`): the left click is the knife, drawn in the blow — he is dead; the right click the knockout — out cold.
//   MELEE     the left click with the hands empty, from EVERY angle (`closeWindows` is the one table: behind = the build's own takedown and gate; the sides and
//             the front = a strike from where he stands, the front one heard a room away). A man who is alert can still be struck (`alertStrike`).
//   GRAB      Space, ONLY from behind (the build's own gate, to the float) — standing or seated (a seated man's rear reach is a little longer: the chair back).
//   THE DARK  `dark`: the one rule of the men's eyes this touches. The build's sight has a floor inside 1.8 m — a shape at his elbow is seen whatever the light.
//             With the switch on that floor is scaled by the light ON Sam (his meter: none of it under `darkAt`, all of it from `litAt`), kept whole for a man
//             who is hunting (alert / searching) and inside `touchM` (he walks into you). Everything else — the cone, the light term, motion, his ears, a torch
//             on Sam — is the build's. So in a dark room he can be passed at arm's length by a man who keeps out of the torches and off the hard floor.
//   MARKS     the windows drawn on the floor (ui/overlay.ts) ship OFF (`marks`): the character is the tell. A play-test switch.
//   NOT HERE  teammates never use any of it (spotted.ts has their one takedown); civilians keep their own rule; nothing under a show (`touring`).
//
// `closeSeat` sits a calm staff man down on a mark (the hold flag + the library's sitting clip, off again the moment he is anything but calm): the build has no
// level that seats a guard by itself yet — the late worker at his desk is the one seated body it ships — so the panel and `__close.seat()` stage one.
//
// DETERMINISM: no dice, no wall clock. Everything here runs off Sam's own position and the men's, inside the frame's usual order (rows → act → update).
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below uses another game module's export at module load.)
