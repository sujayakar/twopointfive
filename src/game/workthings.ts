// A TEAMMATE WORKS A THING IN THE LEVEL — the squad's menu on something Sam could work himself.
//
// The maintainer, with the menu up on the breaker panel of a dark room and nothing on it but 'move there': "teammates should be able to flip the circuit
// breaker etc." So: the orders' menu opened on a thing a man can work with his hand carries that thing's own order on digit 1, where 'move there' is on bare
// floor — and the quick key and the button twice give it, as they give every target's first row. No new digit, no new key, nothing to hold.
//
// WHICH THINGS (things()): the ones Sam has a row of his own for that a teammate's hand makes sense on —
//   · the BREAKER (player.ts 'breakerOff' / 'breakerOn'): throw it, or re-arm the mains — whichever it is not, read when the order is given. Not once a round
//     has wrecked it (Sam has no row then either);
//   · the MISSION'S THING (player.ts 'drive'): the drive in its rack, or a quiet mission's thing in its holder (quiet.ts) — only once the objective is to
//     take it (stage 'drive'), as Sam's own row.
// NOT here, and why: doors and their locks have their own orders (the door's menu, doortools.ts) and a hand on a leaf is another module's (hands.ts); a wall
// has its charge (wallcharge.ts); people have theirs (pairorders.ts); a body wants a place to be carried TO, which one target cannot say; a light has no
// switch a hand can reach in this game (the OCP and a round are Sam's).
//
// WHAT THE MAN DOES: the nearest of the men addressed who can get there goes — one man works it, never two. He walks to a spot an arm off its face that he
// can stand on with a clear line to it (standFor), gun up on the way and low with Sam if the squad is sneaking; squares to it, puts his free hand on it
// (workHand → game.ts handsOnDoors → the animator's door-hand layer), and after the time it takes (the breaker: under a second; the mission's thing: Sam's
// own DRIVE_SECS) does what Sam's row does — Game.setBlackout / endBlackout, mission.ts drivePulled — says so in a word, turns his back to it and HOLDS
// there, where the unasked cover deals him the room's openings. With the whole element addressed his partner comes too, to a mark behind him facing out:
// one works, one covers. A fight takes him as it takes any man under orders (orders.ts' own seam) and gives him back, and he starts the hand again. If the
// thing is no longer there to be worked when he reaches it (somebody else threw it, the drive is already out) he says so and holds.
// A man the orders stop short of it (orders.ts brings a stuck man's mark to his feet and calls him arrived) is NOT at it: he holds where he stopped, the thing
// unworked — the test is his feet on the stand cell, squared to the face, with a clear line to it.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS THE CURSOR BEING ON IT: the breaker's own panel under the ray (workOn), or a point within WORK.pickM of its face on ITS side of the wall it
// hangs on (workNear) — the wall's top, its far face and the next room's floor are not the breaker. Sam's own feet are Sam; a door leaf under the cursor is the door.
//
// ONE THING THIS HAS TO PUT RIGHT, behind its own switch: lighting.ts hands the 'go and check the breaker' errand to the nearest calm man on the guard list
// and lets ANY man standing by the panel re-arm it — a teammate is on that list. With WORK.on neither is a teammate's: he throws a breaker when told to.
//
// THE SWITCH: WORK.on — false here; the page and the shipped stand raise it (host/profile.ts; ?noworkthings = as it was), the frozen stand holds it off
// (TPS_WORKTHINGS=1 raises it). Off: no row, no target, nothing ticks, lighting.ts as it was.
//
// HABITS (coop-door-open-habits): no dice; nothing read off the camera or the canvas (the target is orders.ts', from input); no graphics setting; no GPU
// read; nothing asks for "the" player but orders.ts' own recipients; the state is one short record per man at work, dropped with his order — a checkpoint
// is refused while a unit is on the floor (savestate.ts canSave), so there is nothing to snapshot.
