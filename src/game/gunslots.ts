// A PRIMARY AND A SECONDARY FOR EVERY MAN (GUNSLOTS). The maintainer, 10-18: "also should we model more firearms? and separate primary and secondary slots?"
// Until now you carried two guns (the pistol on 1, the long gun on 2) and a teammate ONE: his card had a single Weapon row and the sidearm on his thigh was
// drawn only. With the switch on every card names two guns — `primary` (a long gun, or none: the pistol alone) and `secondary` (a sidearm) — as two rows where
// the one gun row stood (kit.ts), each a PICK of the table below: what the tile says, and the weapons.ts row it is with a suppressor on and with it off. A
// teammate is staged with both (Guard.second: the gun that is NOT in his hands), and with `dry` he goes to his sidearm when the primary runs dry on a man
// close in front of him — `out` seconds, where standing there changing a magazine is the row's whole reload — and takes the primary up again, reloaded, once
// nobody has been in front of him for `lull` seconds (sideTick). You: 1 is your secondary, 2 your primary, the swap as it was — and which two guns they
// are is your card's (kit.ts kitPlayer builds them from the picks; the issue pair is the pair you were built with).
// Off (the module, the frozen stand, `?nogunslots`): the card of the build before — one gun row — and nobody but you has a second gun. `GUNSLOTS_BREAK=1`
// (tools/qa/gunslots-check.ts): a teammate is staged without his second gun and the card keeps its one gun row.
// The picks ride on the big slot's card (kit.ts BIGSLOT: the shotgun is kit there, never a man's gun): with that switch off the card is the build before's too.
