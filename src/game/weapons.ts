// Weapons as data (docs/internal/sc20k-design.md §2, lane R0). Every firearm on the floor is a row of WEAPONS — what it is called, what it holds, how fast it
// cycles, how it reloads, what its report does to the hearing model and the mixer, what its muzzle shows, how a guard's hands spread it, what it does to loose
// furniture and to a man, where its muzzle and its light sit, what draws it, and what falls out of a dying hand — and a Firearm is one such row being carried:
// chamber + detachable magazines + spares and the staged reload (mag out → fullest spare in → rack if empty). Three rows are in play: Sam's suppressed Five-seveN
// and the guards' 9 mm reproduce, number for number, what the code used to spell out in place (tools/qa/weapons-probes.ts froze those numbers first); the
// guards' AKS-74U-style carbine (docs/internal/sc20k-design.md §3, lane R2) is dealt over a man's sidearm row by the sandbox knob (game.ts tune.carbineGuards):
// short bursts, a 30-round box, the harder report, the rifle that tumbles out of a dying hand; Sam's FN2000 (§5, lane R5) is his second Firearm (game.ts
// Player.rifle, kit slot 2 — a Rifle: the row plus its light switch, its selector on Z, its attachments and the rings left), a row any Character may be handed like the
// others. The AK variants for another setting are rows too, switched off (`enabled: false`, nothing may carry one yet).
// Who reads a row: combat.ts fireWeapon (flash card, light gain, voice, event level, prop kick, a guard's spread) and killGuard / hitPlayer (what leaves the hand);
// guards.ts (cadence, the burst trigger, magazine, the reload beat); player.ts (cadence, the FN2000's AUTO string); ui/overlay.ts (the kit column's name and

 *  to hand-cycle before the next may go. The selector (Z: SEMI / AUTO) is the Firearm's own `mode`; rounds are always on the left button whatever is up. */
