// Civilians (STATUS E12 (d) — the maintainer: "sound great, we'll need them for the campaign"): the building's own night people — Marta, who cleans the
// cubicle floor and the corridor, and Owen, working late at a desk in the cubicle farm — with rules of their own. They fight nobody and nobody fights them
// (teams.ts 'civilian': hostile to no side, no side hostile to them; they are Guard RECORDS for the plumbing that takes one — the arm lock, the ragdoll, the
// bubble, the path follower — kept in Game.civilians, never in Game.guards, so no AI side perceives, lines up or holds fire round one and every loop over the
// shift stays the shift's). ONE MODEL: what they see of Sam is the guards' own eye test (guards.ts eyeContact) reading HIS light meter through the guards' own
// sight-gain arithmetic (sightGain: light^1.5 × distance × crouch × motion across her view × the smoke between them), only less keen and, head down over a desk
// or a bin, narrower; what they hear is the guards' hearing model — the same events, the same horizons, the same propagation round the corners
// (collision.ts SoundPaths) with the suppressed pistol's own 'odd noise' reach — and what the men then hear of HER (a scream) travels the same way back.
// The loop: WORK her route (wipe the desks, empty the bins, sit typing, the cooler, the printer — a library clip laid over the whole figure, character.ts
// `act`) → a glimpse over the glimpse line: STARTLED (she stops, looks, 'hello…?', and mostly talks herself out of it) → clearly seen, or a body, or a gun
// out, or a shot / a charge / a scream in earshot: ALARMED (a frozen beat and a gasp) → FLEE at a run to the NEAREST, by path, of a living calm guard, a
// wall phone, or a way out — never past what frightened her → REPORT (to the man: what and where; he takes it as a fix — a look for 'somebody', weapon out
// and a search of the spot for an armed man or a body, radioed, the floor a step up) / PHONE (six seconds on the line, then control puts it out over the net
// and sends the nearest calm man) / out of the DOOR (gone; control rings the floor a little later) → COWER in a corner (crouched, whimpering; up and off again
// if the man with the gun comes at her). HELD from behind like a guard (player.ts: the same grab, the same arm): she can be QUESTIONED (a thing or two she knows
// — the side door's digits on their sticky note, who walks where), told to get down and stay quiet — COMPLY: let go into a corner, and she tells nobody anything
// unless a guard walks onto her — choked out or pistol-whipped (out cold: priced hard on the card) or shot (a 'civilian casualty': forty points, control's fury
// when they find her, and with tune.civilianKillFails the mission there and then). Guards REACT to her: a scream in earshot or a woman running through his
// torch turns a calm man toward where she came from; one found crouched in a corner is asked what happened and tells him; one found on the floor is a body
// like any body — called in, the floor up (a dead one: lockdown, whatever it was before). The response team coming clears them off the floor (control's line;
// they run for the doors and are gone). `Game.tune.civilians` is the switch (default on; off = nobody but the shift, today's game byte for byte); under the
// showcase tour, the breach's daylight and the attract loop they are not on the floor at all. Authored as data (levels/office.json `civilians`, scene/level.ts
