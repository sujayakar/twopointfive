// THE NET GOES QUIET — a slice of the enemy's morale (morale.ts; the maintainer, 10-13: "especially for stealth sections that aren't perfect ghost where
// enemies just don't [know] what's going on, more poorly trained ones could get really scared" · "a lot of the value from this comes with good telegraphing" ·
// "we don't want them to feel dumb" · "we should never make it adding HP etc." · "we should generally show, not tell". Approved as: "Dread from unanswered
// radio checks and bodies found. Heard in the calls getting worse, seen in beams whipping to noises. Done-test: the last man never dies standing upright
// without firing.")
//
// It needs MORALE on to do anything: every feed here is morale.ts's `moraleShock` (its cap, its nerve), and every behaviour keys off that file's rungs.
//   · FEEDS (shock, × `steadyK` for a steady man — trainingOf, nothing of this file's):
//       (enemysquads.ts's two reach this file through netquietfeed.ts, a leaf: that file sits too early in the import cycle to import this one)
//       a mate who does not answer a radio check — `unanswered` to the man who asked, `heardIt` to every man who heard the check on the net (the squad's
//         check: enemysquads.ts radioCheck · the night staff's roll call: guards.ts updateRollcall · the last defenders' own check: laststand.ts tickCheck — a
//         man too busy to answer is a man who did not answer, and so is a dead one);
//       a body found — `body` to the finder, `bodyTold` to the men he tells (enemysquads.ts event 'found' · guards.ts, the staff's body in view);
//       a mate seen to fall — `fallUnseen` with no enemy in the watcher's view, `fallSeen` with one (combat.ts killGuard, beside moraleManDown: a green man who
//         has just taken that file's leaderShock for the same fall takes only what this one adds over it).
//       ONE DEAD MAN IS ONE SHOCK to one man: the fall he saw, the check nobody answered and the body found pay the largest of the three, not their sum.
//   · THE CALLS GET WORSE, said by the man who asked, on the net, `askBeat` after his check's own line: the first silence a flat repeat of the name (the
//     name the squad's own ask uses); with two checks unanswered "why's nobody answering?"; "somebody talk to me!" only with nobody of his side left on the
//     WHOLE net — every squad's men, not the one he asked on. The finder of a body nobody heard go: "he's down. nobody heard a thing?". The tell first, then
//     the act.
//   · BEAMS WHIP TO NOISES: a jumpy or broken man who HEARS an enemy's noise (his own ears counted it: hearingCheck's gates, nothing of this file's) swings
//     to it `whipShift` after — not after the room fight's own 0.4‥0.9 s —, at `whipTurn` rad/s (broken: `whipTurnBroken`), body and all, and at where HIS
//     EARS put it: the source through open air, the doorway it came round otherwise (the source itself only when it is near that place and in plain view).
//     His fix is never truer than his hearing. `whipSecs` on it (one target `whipHold` at the least; a second noise does not send his eyes back to the door
//     and out again), then the man he was. His lamp follows his aim (guards.ts). A man holding a room has it as what he watches meanwhile (roomfight.ts
//     applyWatch → netQuietLook), so whoever then shows somewhere else catches him turned away: the beat the player can use. Nothing here is asked while he
//     has a man in his eyes.
//   · THE LAST MAN — as far as HE knows it: every man of his squad down and each of them known to him (asked for and silent, seen to fall, found, told of on
//     the net), nobody of his side at his elbow; or nobody of his side left at all AND a check gone unanswered in his hearing (if nobody has asked, he asks
//     the net himself once he has been roused `calmSecs`: "all posts, answer up" — and it is the silence that has him act). At his post, he says his line —
//     his squad's ("nobody left in here but me") or, with nobody on the net, the last one —, and `lastBeat` later stops guarding his room upright: he backs,
//     facing them, to the spot in it where every entry sits inside one `arcDeg` arc (else the narrowest arc there is), goes LOW (half down: `crouch`), on his
//     gun (roused, as any defender who has taken a new post is: roomfight.ts plant), and holds the doors in his EYES — the floor's eye sits round from a
//     man's gun, so his gun rests off the arc's middle by what that takes; no wandering glance. He does not rally to a fight next door meanwhile
//     (roomfight.ts rally → netQuietHolds), nor is he his squad's to send (enemysquads.ts home → netquietfeed.ts). `alertSecs` of nothing seen or heard and
//     he is no longer 'alert' — wary (`wary`), still low on the spot; anything he hears has him on his gun again. A living mate at his side for `calmSecs`
//     and he is up, the act dropped, his owner's again. A man morale.ts's own sequence has (`moraleOwns`) is that file's.
//   · A MAN WHO HAS RUN (runner.ts `runnerOwns`: the shout, the drop, the run, gone) is nobody's mate on the net: he hears no check, answers none (asked for by name
//     he is a silence like a dead man's), is not whipped, is never the last man — and to the man he left he is one more gone, once that man knows it. The last
//     man at his act is not stopped at a dark doorway nor called to one (darkdoor.ts asks netquietfeed.ts): his hold wins.
//   No health, aim, skill or reaction table is read or written: where he stands, how low, where he looks — and, low on his spot, the floor's own alert /
//   wary lines (rouse, ease, wary: the only writes to a man's state in this file).
// SHOW, NOT TELL: nothing is drawn or written for the player but the men themselves. One die (simRandom, only for which line of a pool), no wall clock, no
// graphics setting. The switch is off in the module and on the frozen stand: every seam returns on its first line, no man is met, no die is drawn.
