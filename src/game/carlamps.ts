// A PARKED VEHICLE'S LAMPS CAN BE SHOT OUT (the maintainer, from a play test: "taillights in cars should be able to be shot up, and headlights and all that").
// Every level file has its cars and pickups as plain boxes: the car's tail lamps glow and are in no switchable; every head lamp, and every lamp of a pickup, a
// van or the lorry, is a dead lens that glows not at all. None of them was a light target, so a round did nothing to one and the reticle never took one.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES, with the switch up: when the Game is built (game.ts, beside the level's switchables) each lamp box found in the level becomes a light target
// of its own — kind 'emissive', group 'vehicle', off the mains, no contactor stagger (so no die is drawn for it), and no area light stood in for it (the
// picture of an unbroken lamp is the picture as it was). A glowing tail lamp is ON and dies like any fixture: the glow goes, the glass comes down, a man with a
// line to it saw a light go out. A dead lens is OFF, and still glass: a round that meets it breaks it (combat.ts asks `lampGlass`), with the glass and the
// sound and no light event — nothing went out. A broken lamp's box is painted dark (updateTargets calls `carLampPaint`), and unpainted when a load or a
// restart finds it whole again; the paint follows the target's own `broken` bit, which a checkpoint already keeps by name, and the level's own paint rides
// on the target (`lens`), so this module keeps no state a save or a snapshot would need.
//
// HOW A LAMP IS FOUND: the level files carry no name for one, so by what the generators write (scene/officeGen.ts and scene/levelKit.ts car, scene/gwotKit.ts
// pickup and van, the pass's lorry): its half size, its paint or its glow, and its twin the same height and yaw across the vehicle's width. tools/qa/
// carlamps-check.ts counts what every level file gives and fails on a vehicle whose lamps are not found, so a generator that moves a lamp is caught there.
//
// The switch is read ONCE, when the Game is built: a recording from before the table has it put down before its level is stood up (replay/engineplay.ts and
// tools/qa/rerun.ts `tables`), and the debugger's row reloads the page with the word on the address.
// ONE switch, CARLAMPS.on: ON in the page (`?carlamps=0` = as it was), OFF in the module and on the frozen harness stand (`TPS_CARLAMPS=1`); a FROZEN_HOLDS
// row, in the knob registry and a journal's tables (a recording from before the table replays with none). Off = no target, no row, no box touched: the build
// as it was by run digest. On, a checkpoint from before the switch is refused as another floor's (the count of light targets is part of a save's key).
// Nothing here has been seen on a GPU.
