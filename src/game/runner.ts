// DROPS IT AND RUNS — THE SECOND SLICE OF THE ENEMY'S MORALE (the maintainer, 10-13: "let's not add surrendering to our mechanics. instead, enemies drop their
// weapons and run" — and, as of morale.ts, "a lot of the value from this comes with good telegraphing": he SAYS it, then he DOES it, with a beat the player can
// act on). Nobody ever puts his hands up.
//   · WHO: a man morale.ts has BROKEN (its rung 2), who is ALONE, who is DRY — that file's bait burst has run his magazine out and he is mid-change, or his gun is
//     empty by its own count — and who has an enemy plainly in his eyes inside `closeM`. Never on dread alone: the player causes it on purpose — bait the burst,
//     step in during the dry window. Never a civilian, an operative or the player; never a choreographed man, a man of the hostage rescue's cast or of the
//     response team (morale.ts's own list, and qrf.ts owns). OR, with rounds still in his gun: a broken GREEN man who SAW HIS LEADER FALL (morale.ts
//     sawLeaderFall) with an enemy plainly in his eyes inside `closeM` — the same shout, the same beat, the same run. `runnerBreak` starts the same sequence directly (a later slice: a broken man whose leader is
//     killed in his view).
//   · SAY, THEN DO: he shouts it — spoken, not on the net — and holds, low, gun down, for `beatSecs`; then the weapon leaves his hand and lies on the floor where
//     he dropped it (combat.ts dropFromHand: the item a dying hand lets go of), and he runs.
//   · UNARMED FROM THEN ON, and FLED (`runnerFled`): his gun's own count is kept at nothing and no magazine change is ever his again, so no fire site has a
//     round of his; guards.ts inHand says his hand is empty, so killGuard has nothing more to drop; he is drawn with empty hands (combat.ts guardProps: the
//     rifleman's sidearm stays on his thigh, never drawn — with `anyway` it is on the floor beside the rifle and the thigh is empty; the pistol man's holster
//     is empty); his light went with the gun. He perceives nothing and fights
//     nobody: guards.ts runs this file's GuardScript every frame from the shout on, the room fight's defender tick yields (`runnerOwns`), and morale.ts's own
//     sequence is let go of (moraleRelease) and kept let go of.
//   · WHERE HE RUNS, at the guards' own chase pace (Game.tune.guardChase) and no faster: to a living armed MATE first — the nearest BY THE FLOOR, inside
//     `mateM` of path — and inside `tellM` of him with a clear line he shouts it and the mates in earshot (`toldM`) are TOLD through the game's own records:
//     roomfight.ts told (what a loud noise out that way does to a man on a post: the entry toward it gains a point of evidence, so his watch turns to it; the
//     post's noise record reads the place, which the squads' ears and the dig-in read) and digin.ts digInOrder (the last stand's order: he starts on his room
//     after `tellBeat`; it runs for a man wherever DIGIN.on or a squad is staged); a mate with no post of the room fight's (the night staff) has the place put
//     in his head at `tellAware`, the floor's own rules from there. Then he KEEPS GOING, out of the building: the nearest floor he can reach that lies outside
//     the structure's rooms under open sky (roomfight.ts outOfBuilding's test, `clearM` clear of the walls), for choice one no enemy has a line to — on a
//     level with no structure, the rim of the walkable map (`edgeM`). With no mate that near he tells nobody and goes straight out. The way is planned round
//     the enemies he knows of (`shyM`) and looked at again every `replanSecs`: an enemy who steps into the `aheadM` in front of him sends him another way (or
//     to the corner). An enemy at arm's length never holds him where he stands: he may always step AWAY. He waits on no door drill, no lane, nobody's
//     manners in a doorway (guards.ts followPath: those three gates pass a fled man) — a leaf that opens toward him he still has to pull.
//   · WHO HE KNOWS OF (picture.ts PICTURE.run; off = as it was: every living enemy where he truly stands, through any wall): the way, the floor he may
//     reach, the outside he picks, the corner and the wall he turns his face to are all reckoned from HIS OWN PICTURE — the men he has seen, heard fire or
//     been told of, each where he believes him to be, a place he has since seen empty or an idea gone stale left out. A man he knows nothing of bars no
//     way of his until he sees him: then the look ahead sends him another way, as above. What the WORLD decides stays the truth: he is taken off the
//     floor only when no enemy truly has a line to him, and is low while one has — and stopped outside with a man's eyes on him he looks about him and
//     has that man (a line runs both ways), so he goes on to floor that man cannot see. From the drop on he is off his side's net in the picture too
//     (picture.ts onNet), as netquiet.ts and enemysquads.ts have him.
//   · HE RUNS FOR IT NO MATTER WHAT (`anyway`; off = as it was. The maintainer: 'if a guy gives up he should drop his gun (including pistol) and just run
//     for it no matter what'): the way round every enemy he knows of is still his first choice. But the floor he may reach is walled off round every one
//     of them alike — a man in his eyes, a sound he placed in a doorway, a mate's word about a man since shot — so one idea on the only door between him
//     and the outside sent him to the corner, for good (from a recorded game on the block: the fire exit two shut doors away). So when that leaves him NO
//     way out he looks once more with nobody as a wall and runs the way it finds (`Run.bold`): the enemies still dear to the path (route's own cost) and
//     still minded in the pick of the outside floor, and nobody stepping into his way a reason to think again. Only a floor that gives him no way out at
//     all — a locked door — leaves him the corner, and he never settles there: every `retrySecs` he looks again, with no `retries` to run out of. And BOTH guns go: a rifleman's sidearm is put on the floor beside his rifle (`Run.bare`; combat.ts
//     guardKit draws his thigh empty, alive or shot later).
//   · NOBODY'S ENEMY ON THE BOOKS (`nobody`; off = as it was): the readers outside this file that walk the roster ask `runnerNobody` (from the drop: he
//     counts for nothing — fogofwar.ts's 'contact' and 'steps' calls, doortools.ts's 'room clear', morale.ts and
//     darkdoor.ts's company) or `runnerMute` (from the shout: he speaks for nobody — cues.ts, suppression.ts's barks).
//   · GONE: out, and no enemy with a line to him for `goneSecs`, a spawned unit is taken out of the world (guards.ts despawnUnit). A man of the level's own
//     roster is never removed (a checkpoint is poured over that roster): he stays low where he got to. With no way out he goes to the reachable corner
//     farthest from every enemy and stays low there, his face to the wall, silent, still fled — and looks again for a way out every `retrySecs`, until
//     `retries` runs at a way that would not let him through (a door that will not open) have come to nothing: then he stays.
//   · COUNTING: a fled man is nobody's living hostile — every ending that counts them asks `runnerFled`, a scenario's "my cast was taken away" test passes
//     over him, his squad counts him out (enemysquads.ts alive); the team's eyes pass over him (roomfight.ts tickOp, guards.ts acquireFoe, the breach's
//     target queue). He is nobody's calm colleague either (Guard.hold + pinned: no chat, no need, no greeting, no errand is his). A grenade he was winding up
//     stays on his belt (frag.ts). The player may shoot him: it is a kill like any other, and nothing here scores or answers it.
// SHOW, NOT TELL: nothing is drawn or written for the player but the man himself. One die (simRandom), no wall clock, no graphics setting; the clocks are seconds
// COUNTED and ride a checkpoint with the rest (runnerSnapshot / Restore).
// The switch is off in the module and on the frozen stand, and acts only with MORALE.on: every seam returns on its first line, no man is met, no die is drawn.
// Type-only game imports but for the functions below, used inside calls only (src/game is one import cycle).
