// THE ONE LIST OF KNOB TABLES. A knob table is a module-level object of switches and numbers that changes how the game plays (AIM, DOORWAY, ROOMFIGHT,
// SQUADS …): flipped by a Tab row, a URL flag, a probe, a play-through's --set. Hand-kept lists of them used to stand side by side — what a session recording
// carries (journal.ts), what a play-through's --set reaches and puts back (tools/qa/playthrough.ts), what the probe runner snapshots round every probe
// (tools/qa/probes.ts, plus nine tables named by hand) — and a table added to one was missing from the others. Those three read this file now:
//   knobRegistry()   every table by name (LAZY — see below)
//   JOURNAL_KNOBS    the names a recording carries and a replay applies (journal.ts knobTables), in the order the file has always listed them
//   knobsCopy()      a deep copy of the tables · knobsBack() puts one back IN PLACE (the probe runner's and the play-through's: what a run changed is undone)
//   assignDeep()     the journal's rule for laying a FILE's tables over the live ones (only keys the build still has, type for type)
// A NEW TABLE takes an import line here, an entry in knobRegistry()'s literal, and its name in JOURNAL_KNOBS when a replay needs it. STILL ITS OWN LIST: the
// squad's feel panel (teamfeel.ts feelTables + KEPT — which rows a machine keeps, with their ranges; left alone, it is where merges collide most) — and
// tools/qa/knobs-check.ts (`probes.ts journal-knobs`) fails when the feel panel or a recording names a table that is not here, and lists the switch tables
// under src/game the registry does not hold yet. A few tally tools keep purpose-built --set lists of their own (pairsneak.ts, bang-tally.ts, roomclear-tally.ts).
// (src/game is one import cycle and the browser bundle hoists module bindings: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load — the
// registry is made on each call. The imports keep journal.ts's old order first, so the modules a recording names evaluate in the order they always did.)
