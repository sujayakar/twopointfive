// GLASS PENETRATION — what a pane is to a ROUND, and to the question 'have I a shot from here' (rebuild/glass/penetration.md is the record; the maintainer, 10-08:
// "we should support bullets penetrating"). Until this a round that met a pane stopped in it (glass.ts: 'laminated: rounds stop, glass stays') and the line of
// FIRE (collision.ts shotBlocked) treated intact glass as a wall — a man who SAW his enemy through a window had no shot. Behind ONE switch, `GLASSPEN.on`
// (shipped ON; the harness stands at OFF like the other post-digest defaults — src/host/standup.ts; `?glasspen=0|1`, env GLASSPEN=on|off, Tab ▸ Renderer fx ▸
// Glass): off — or a showcase running (Game.touring: their choreography was laid with glass stopping rounds) — = every entry point answers on its first line
// and the game is the base's, digest for digest.
//
//   THE RULE (one for Sam, the squad and the defenders — fireWeapon asks nobody whose round it is):
//   • a round carries ENERGY, 1 = a rifle round at the muzzle (GLASSPEN.energy by weapon row, else by class): 5.56 1.0 · 5.45 carbine 0.9 · 5.7 0.6 · 9 mm 0.5;
//   • a SHEET of glass (glass.ts isSheet: ≤ 10 cm through — the cooler bottle is solid glass and stops everything, as ever) takes
//       toll = cost[type] × (thickness ∕ 12 mm) × min(obliqueMax, 1 ∕ cos θ) × (holeK if the round goes through a hole a round already made)
//     of it — type from the fracture model's own typing (GlassBreak.typeOf: annealed 0.10, tempered 0.16, laminated 0.42), θ off the pane's normal;
//   • what is left < minEnergy, or θ past the graze angle (grazeCos), or the (maxPanes + 1)th pane: the round is SPENT IN THE PANE — exactly the old stop
//     (the star, the crack heard, nothing beyond). So a 9 mm goes through three plain panes and stops in the fourth, and dies in ONE laminated sheet; a rifle
//     round goes through one laminated sheet and (just) a second;
//   • otherwise it goes ON from the far face, turned a little: toward the pane's normal by bendK × A × sin θ (rounds through raked glass break toward the
//     perpendicular) plus a scatter inside a cone of half-angle A = deflectDeg × (toll ∕ energy in) — 0.5° for a rifle through a plain pane, 1° for a 9 mm,
//     2° for a rifle through laminated — its bearing and size HASHED off where it hit (glass.ts hitSeed: the same shot bends the same way; never Math.random);
//   • every pane crossed gets the fracture part's impact call ONCE, at the entry point with the incoming direction (paneImpact below — today glass.ts glassHit:
//     the star, the crack, the 'glass' hearing event, GlassBreak.hit) and GLASSPEN_HOOKS.crossed the crossing whole (entry, EXIT point, direction out, energy
//     taken) for whoever throws the spall off the far face;
//   • a crossing within holeR of an earlier one on that pane goes through the HOLE: a quarter of the toll, a quarter of the turn (the second round through the
//     same spot flies true — the doctrine: the first round is for the glass). The list is per pane, ≤ `holes`, gone with the encounter (resetGlassPen).
//   The holes ride in checkpoints (savestate.ts `glassPen`, written only when there are any: a file saved with the switch off is the base's) and the switch rides
//   in session journals (journal.ts knobTables) — a load, and a replay, pay what the live game paid.
//   • A LOAD OF SHOT (shotgun.ts: a shell is nine rounds through fireWeapon) MARKS A PANE ONCE PER PLACE — the one rule for a pellet that goes through and for
//     one that stops in the sheet (rebuild/gear-and-glass/pellets.md): a pellet that meets the glass within shellR of a mark ITS OWN SHELL has already made on that
//     pane makes no mark of its own — no star, no crack heard, no event, no hole remembered, no exit jet. What it leaves in the glass is by what it did: one
//     that WENT THROUGH took its energy on with it, and only if a piece of the broken glass still stood where it passed does that piece go (GlassBreak.widen:
//     the hole is ragged, and it is ONE hole); one that STOPPED there left its energy in the sheet, on the mark it landed on (the fracture model's tally —
//     GlassBreak.impact without glass.ts's star and noise: toughened glass still dices at its break energy, a web's star grows heavier, no new star is cut).
//     A pellet anywhere else on the pane is its own mark, exactly as a round is. A pellet that goes through joins only a mark that went through (it never
//     passes 'by the hole' of a pellet that stopped); one that stops joins either kind. So a muzzle pressed to the glass files ONE crossing at the arm point,
//     not nine; a shell from a metre is a few marks in one ragged hole; from across a room it is nine pocks a hand apart, and those are nine blows. Each pellet
//     still pays the pane's toll by its own line and flies on (or not) as its own round. shellR 0 = every pellet its own mark (NOT the old behaviour — that
//     is the glass parts off: every third pellet stars a pane nothing passes).
//   A round that is through is a round: one-shot both ways as ever (no hit points anywhere — what the pane took decides only whether it gets through the NEXT
//   one, and how hard it shoves the furniture it meets: propImpulse × what is left).
//
//   ONE MODEL: StaticCollision.shotBlocked (guards.ts clearShot — the alert branch's `blocked`, the room fight's every round, the standoff; tactics.ts losOpen;
//   the squads' / pressure's / the rescue crew's stations; breach.ts) asks THE SAME TOLL through StaticCollision.glassPen with the energy of the gun in that
//   man's hands (roundEnergyOf; a caller with no man in hand gets defaultEnergy = the sidearm's: a station is never counted on for a line a pistol would not
//   have) — so a man fires through a pane exactly when his round would get through it, and one whose 9 mm dies in the manager's laminated sidelight still goes
//   round by the door. Eyes always passed glass (segmentBlocked); feet and sound still do not (solidBlocked).
