/** A WEAPON LIGHT STOPS AT A WALL. A man's light is a light AT ITS LENS — on the carbine's handguard, under the pistol's rail, at the hand torch's glass — and a man
 *  pressed to a wall (stacked on a door, crossing its frame, backed into a corner) has the reach to carry that lens into the wall or out through its far face: a
 *  shadow ray stops a few centimetres short of the emitter it is cast at, so a light that close to the far face lit the room beyond, and to the CPU's light
 *  estimate the men in it. Rounds have their own rule for the pressed muzzle (combat.ts armThrough); this is the light's, and it asks more: any leaf and an
 *  intact pane stop the LENS too (the light then shines through the pane from this side, as light does).
 *  `gap` = how far short of the surface the EDGE of the emitter (lens + its radius) is kept, metres. Off = the light at its lens wherever that is, as it was —
 *  the table's own value, so a host that never says otherwise is unchanged. The page turns it on (src/host/profile.ts pageSwitches; ?nolightwall = off) and so
 *  does the harness's shipped stand; its frozen stand holds it off (src/host/standup.ts; TPS_LIGHTWALL=1 turns it on there). */
