// QUIET ORDERS FOR ONE PARTNER (two person stealth): what Sam can tell the one AI teammate while the pair is still unseen, in the squad order menu's own grammar
// (orders.ts: X / the middle button opens the menu on what the cursor is on, a digit 1‥5 picks, B gives the target's first row at once, F is the word).
//
//   THE SWITCH. `PAIR.on`, OFF by default (`?pairorders` for the visit, Tab ▸ Sandbox ▸ Team feel; the harness leaves it off). Off — or with a squad of more
//   than `PAIR.maxSquad` men, or none — nothing here is on the menu, a person is not a target, no built-in row is touched and the two seams in the room fight
//   return on their first line: the game as it was (probes.ts pair-identity; the playthrough digests against the base).
//
//   A PERSON IS A TARGET. With the cursor on a defender the team can see (not one the fog of war hides), the menu opens ON HIM, as it does on a door:
//     1  take him · on your mark   the partner works round to the man's BACK unseen (stalk: the floor in front of every defender priced all but shut), stops a
//                                  few paces short, says 'set.' and WAITS. The MARK is F — or Sam's own hands going onto a man (his takedown, his grab:
//                                  `markOnHands`), so two men go down on one beat. On the mark he closes the last paces and puts the man out cold, quietly.
//                                  F before he is set: he goes as soon as he can get there.
//     2  watch him                 where he stands, gun on the man, no round while the man has not noticed anybody
//     3  fall in                   the built-in row ('on me')
//     4  hold position             the built-in row ('wait here')
//     5  take him now              the same job with no waiting: the partner picks his own moment (on the heels of the man's glance)
//   and on FLOOR, while the squad is silent (silent.ts: with no silent order in the build there is no such row):
//     1  move there · hold in the dark   in place of 'move there': the dark floor at, or nearest, the point — crouched, gun low. No dark floor within `darkM`:
//                                  refused, 'nowhere dark there.' (`darkRefuse` off: he goes anyway and says it is lit)
//   AN ORDER THAT CANNOT BE DONE IS REFUSED WITH A CUE — greyed on the menu with the reason, and said by the man when given by B: no way to the man ("can't get
//   there."), no floor at his back ('no room at his back.'), the man already down, the man already roused ("he's fighting. no hands."). A job that goes wrong
//   under way ends in words too: seen ("he's seen me!" — he stands with his gun on the man and the fight is the fight layer's), no way round unseen for
//   `stalkWait` s ('no way to his back unseen.'), not done in `takeSecs` ("can't get to his back."). Any other order cancels the job where he stands.
//
//   NOT HERE (other parts of the goal): how the partner moves and follows while nobody is alerted — his pace, his crouch, how well he sneaks — and what he does
//   once a guard is suspicious. The stalk's own pace and crouch are knobs here until that part gives him a sneaking grade to read.
//
// No module-level table is built from another game module's exports (src/game is one import cycle): PAIR is a plain literal, the rows are made in seat().
