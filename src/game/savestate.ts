// Checkpoints (STATUS G5): the whole encounter serialised to plain JSON — `saveState(g)` → SaveState v1, `loadState(g, s)` puts it back — plus the autosave rules,
// the slots in localStorage, export / import, and the down / pause cards' 'restart from checkpoint'. The QA harness (tools/qa/headless.ts snapshot / restore,
// probes.ts checkpoints, soak --checkpoint-at) runs the same two functions to start a situation mid-level.
//
// WHAT A CHECKPOINT HOLDS (SaveState below is the schema; every subsystem's slice sits next to the code that reads it back):
//   - the clock: Game.time itself (every stamp in the game is against it, so it comes back as it was — a load an hour into a page puts g.time BACK to the save's;
//     nothing outside the Game reads g.time), eventSeq, fxSeed, the OCP cooldown, the last half second of hearing events, the HUD's message lines;
//   - Sam: position / facing / crouch, the kit (slot, canisters, stun cans, the pistol's and the FN2000's chamber / magazine / spares / light / selector / attachment /
//     rings, 40 mm rounds, the OCP's charge), holstered, night vision, pace, keys, door codes, hits left, the whistle's breath; under SAVETIMELINE.holds his wall hold and
//     the close-in mode's held gait (without it NOT the wall hold: a load stands him free of it); NOT a body in tow, a man in his arm,
//     a lock / pad / leaf / drive under his hands, a wind-up, the launcher's button held on its arc, a reload half done — an autosave never happens mid-action, and a forced save drops them (see canSave);
//     a man alone with charges of his own (owncharge.ts): the optional `own` — the door tools' count, the wall charges carried, the door charges that stand set (put back on their
//     doors) and what his hands took from the bag this run; a WALL charge set and not blown is not saved — it is back in the count;
//   - every man of the level's roster (units — the response team, the showcase casts — are never in a checkpoint: a save is refused while any exists): state,
//     position / velocity / facing, awareness, the fix and its clocks, waypoint + wait, path, the errand (breaker / rack / device / check-on), the body script, the
//     lockdown pair / post, drawn, keys, weapon (row by id, chamber, magazine, bursts), the torch's clocks, dazzle / stagger, witness + interrogation records (sets as
//     arrays; the dealt script by id), muzzle / line-of-fire clocks, the search's fix time, his bubble, needs (levels + the trip under way), whistle memory; NOT his
//     search plan / doorway pie / standoff / flanking role (rebuilt within a frame by the code that deals them), nor a script (refused);
//   - BODIES: how / by whom / when he went down, found or not, the aftermath's counters, the ragdoll's sixteen particles and trunk rotation — a body comes back as
//     a SETTLED corpse at exactly those joint positions, asleep (Ragdoll.settleAt), not re-simulated: the frozen local pose under it is a neutral stance's rather
//     than the death frame's, so a sleeve's twist may sit a few degrees off; anything that disturbs it (a leaf, a drag) simulates on from there as ever;
//   - items on the floor (dropped guns / torches / magazines / spent cans / rings: kind, pose, who) with the guards' `dropped` links; an item still in the AIR or
//     on its FUSE is written as lying spent where it was — a checkpoint never re-throws a canister (autosave waits for them to land / go off anyway); a ring or a
//     40 mm round in FLIGHT is not an item and is not written (a plain save waits for it, canSave; a forced one files the count already spent and no round);
//   - doors (angle, velocity, latch, lock / broken keep, pick progress, noticed — and, while doors.ts DOORWAY is on, the pull in hand / press / driven clocks;
//     an angle saved on the side a door does not open into, a file from before it had one, is stood as wide on the side it does), loose furniture (pose + velocity, asleep or not), every light target (on /
//     broken / OCP restrike clock), the blackout record, the beacons follow; the devices (camera pan phase + integrator + report state, tripwire counts / clocks,
//     the log); the mission record whole; the CHRONICLE (timeline, counters, questioned, the path — thinned to ≤ PATH_KEEP points the way the chronicle thins itself
//     — so the debrief survives a load; a 'checkpoint' row is appended on save and on load); escalation level + clock, the alarm episode, rooms cleared, the radio
//     check's state, the tactics' kill-zone doorways, the ambient dialogue's ledger + the handler's radio state, the QRF's gunfire memory, the storm (rate, wind,
//     wetness, the stroke schedule AND its dice; a picked WEATHER KIND and its thunder mask's clock — weather.ts: headless a load puts the file's kind in, in the
//     page a file made in another weather than the URL's is refused), everybody's wet coat, the decal ring (bullet holes, scorch, scuffs, chips, glass stars — the level's memory of the
//     run; wet footprints are let go), the autosave controller's own memory (rooms visited, quiet clock, run id);
//   - what a blast took of the level: the walls' slice (wallbreak.ts) and the furniture's (furnblast.ts `furn`: the statics that broke, the props that came
//     apart) — each absent when nothing broke, each re-applied silently right after the restart; the PIECES on the floor are not written (no debris is);
//   - the CIVILIANS (civilians.ts CivSnap): each one's place and gait, her mark and its wait, the walk under way, her ears' marker, what frightened her (what /
//     where / armed), whom she is running to or has told (men by callsign, phones / doors by name), the corner and the 'stay down' promise, her dice, a downed
//     one's particles laid down asleep like the men's; the floor's queue of words due (a guard's radio call a beat after her report, control's call after she
//     got out) as data; one HELD at a forced save is filed held and comes off the vanished arm on the first frame after the load exactly as off a cancelled hold;
//   - the HOUR the level is being played at and its sun's strength (hours.ts; `hour`, absent for the level's own night): a load lays the file's hour over the
//     game BEFORE the restart — the light list, the sky, the outside lamps and the storm's switch follow the file, whatever hour the page was opened at;
//   - NOT SAVED, on purpose: smoke in the air (the solver's fields are GPU-resident and 100+ MB: a screen you were counting on is gone after a load, its can lies
//     there spent), sparks / tracers / GPU particles / muzzle flashes (transient), the light meter's readings (re-read next frame; visibility restarts at 0),
//     suppression scalars and aim-settle tracks (rest), what each man knew of a man behind breakable cover and the piece he was putting rounds into
//     (coverfire.ts: forgotten with the roster, re-learnt from his next sighting), speech in the air other than the bubbles' text, the audio mixer, the camera (main.ts snaps it to Sam);
//     and of the last half second's hearing events a WHISTLE is let go (whistle.ts resolves each event object once for the whole floor and everybody in earshot
//     heard it the frame it sounded — put back as a fresh object it would be answered a second time).
//     Nor the animator's own momentum: with the movement pass on (character.ts MOVES — the page; off under the harness) the recoil sums, the glide's spring and
//     a reaction under way restart on a load: poses a few centimetres off for a moment, so with it on 'continue ≡ load' is the harness's statement, not the
//     page's. The turn weight (TURN) IS filed, under SAVETIMELINE.turn: a man caught mid-turn carries the turn itself (GuardSnap.turn, character.ts turnSnap /
//     turnPut / bakeLoaded) and goes on coming round after a load; with the switch off, or in a file from before the key, he starts from rest, facing where
//     his weight had let him get to.
//
// DETERMINISM: the game's dice (barks, spread, jitter) come through math/dice.ts simRandom(). A game that OWNS its die (the page: host/standup.ts StandOpts.seed)
// has the stream's position in the file (`dice`), so the frames after a load roll what the frames after the save rolled. A game on Math.random (the QA harness)
// cannot have that stream captured — but everything ELSE
// that decides the next frame is in the file. So: with the QA harness's seeded Math.random re-seeded to the same value right after the save and right after the
// load, the next ten seconds digest identically (probes.ts checkpoints (a): continue-after-save ≡ load-into-the-same-game ≡ load-into-a-fresh-game, over
// guards / Sam / doors / mission / chronicle / lights / devices / items / civilians; tools/qa/dice-check.ts holds the same three ways for a game on its own die,
// with nothing re-seeded). In a browser page opened with ?seed=off the dice differ after a load, so a bark's wording or a round's millimetres may; nothing structural does. Exceptions by construction: a conversation two men were having is cut short (they walk on), a searcher re-deals his
// hiding spots, a flanking pair re-deals its roles, a whistle in the air is not answered again — all inside a second of the load.
//
// AUTOSAVE (Checkpoints.tick, once a frame at the end of Game.update): a REQUEST is raised by (1) the mission stage advancing, (2) Sam's first entry into a room
// region this run (chronicle.ts roomOf), (3) a body let go of ≥ BODY_HIDE_M from where he took hold of it ('hidden'), (4) every QUIET_SECS (90) of undetected
// play; a request is WRITTEN once the gates pass — a live run (missionLive: not the tour / attract / breach, not done or failed), the AI on, no man alert or
// searching or with awareness > AWARE_MAX (0.4), no civilian startled / frightened / running / telling / on the phone, none hiding from HIM untold, no word of
// theirs still on its way (civilians.ts civilianCompromise), Sam not down and not mid-action (pick / code / ease / kick / takedown / hold / drag / drive / a
// wind-up or a canister not yet gone off / a reload), no unit on the floor and the QRF idle, nobody scripted, DEBOUNCE_SECS (2) after the request and never within
// MIN_GAP_SECS (10) of the last save — and DROPPED if the gates have not passed within PENDING_SECS (25). Each autosave: the next of AUTO_SLOTS (3) rotating
// slots in localStorage (`twopointsix.save.auto.N`, index in `twopointsix.save.index`), a 'checkpoint' row in the chronicle, a discreet CHECKPOINT tag on the
// HUD (overlay.ts reads `flash`). One MANUAL slot besides (`twopointsix.save.manual`: Tab ▸ Checkpoints ▸ save now, or an import). Sizes: ~40–90 KB typical, the
// worst case (700 timeline rows, 512 decals, PATH_KEEP path points) under 200 KB — `SaveResult.bytes` says.
//
// REFUSED (canSave → a reason): the tour / attract / breach or any puppet beat, daylight, a unit on the floor or the QRF past idle (the response is a set piece:
// no checkpoint inside it), Sam down, the run OVER (stage failed / done — a civilian killed under tune.civilianKillFails fails it with Sam still standing; canLoad
// refuses such a file too rather than pour it over a living man), a body (a man's or a civilian's) still falling, a man scripted or the lockdown pair clearing
// rooms (unless `force`, which files them as searching men and drops the drill), Sam mid-action (unless `force`, which lets go of everything the way a teleport
// does — in the FILE, never in the running game: saving is read-only).
