// X IS WHERE THE PLAN IS LAID (PLANLAY.on; the maintainer, 10-13: 'X is the sweatier mode where you can micromanage them a bit' — and the Door Kickers 2
// focus list's item 7: 'The plan is laid in real time at the start mark, waits on F and survives Enter').
//
// The order menu's 'wait for my word' row used to be the squad of four's, on a door, for a door tool: the men walked to the door, stacked and waited for
// the word. With the switch on that row is under EVERY menu that has an order in it (a door, a spot on the floor, a teammate, nothing; the pair too), and
// a row picked with it on is LAID, not given:
//   · NOBODY MOVES. The order is written down (LaidOrder: the row, the men by callsign, the door by its place on the level's list or the spot) and the
//     menu goes away. A man has ONE laid order: laying him another replaces it, and an order given him at once (the menu with the row off, B) takes his
//     name off the plan — a laid order nobody is left on is gone;
//   · THE WORD'S KEY SENDS IT (doortools.ts blowKey, F), all of it, in the order it was laid — read in orders.ts input ahead of every other reader of that
//     key, and taken out of the frame. Each laid order is then GIVEN as the menu would give it (SquadOrders.give: the refusals asked afresh, a man says
//     why not), a door tool of the four's on the word as it always could be: they walk, stack and wait, and F again (or B on the door) is 'go' — two
//     doors laid are two stacks that go on one word. Where every laid door tool finds its men ALREADY on its door (stacked on it, holding it from
//     outside) there is nothing to walk to and the press is the word itself: they go — which is the row as it was, for men at a door. With the menu up
//     the key is still its 'wait for my word' row (or a row of that page that is on the key and can be given: 'go' with somebody waiting);
//   · LAYING IS FREE OF THE CLOCK: nothing is put in the order book until the plan is sent, so the par clock (par.ts: the first row of orders.log) has not
//     started and the squad's fight has not either;
//   · IT SURVIVES ENTER (`keep`): the first plan sent in a try is kept, and a fresh cast of the same men on the same level
//     (orders.ts sync: a restart) finds it laid again — to be sent as it is, or changed first;
//   · IT IS DRAWN ONLY IN THE ORDER MODE (floorplan.ts → ui/planfloor.ts): each man's way from his feet to the door or the spot, broken, and the key on
//     it; with the menu down a laid order is drawn as it is laid and fades like an order just given. The squad's HUD block has the key's line while a plan
//     waits. The menu opens with the row already ON while a plan is laid: the second order of a plan is one key shorter than the first.
//
// PER SEAT, for a second player: the plan is the squad's orders-to-be and lives with the order book (SquadOrders.lay); who lays and who sends is whoever's
// input the order book reads. STATE: LayState, plain data — `laySnapshot` / `layRestore` are its pair (savestate.ts files it with the switch on).
// Off (the module's default, the frozen stand): the row is where it was and means what it meant, nothing is ever laid, the key is the word's alone.
