// TWO CHARGES, ONE CLOCK: the overlay of a defuse mission (scene/scenarioList.ts rows on a level whose file carries a `scenarios.defuse` block — scene/scenarios.ts
// DefuseData: the charges, each a point on a thing in a room, and the seconds they share). Under it is a plain ROOM CLEAR on that level (roomclear.ts): the
// defenders, the rooms, the orders and the door tools are that scenario's own, untouched. What this file adds:
//
//   THE CLOCK     one for every charge. It starts on the team's first move (an order given, or Sam a stride off his start) — never while the squad stands
//                 formed up — and runs on the game clock. At zero EVERY charge still live goes off: frag.ts blast() at its place (the game's own blast: the
//                 room's men judged by distance and cover, the destruction's blast, the bang in everybody's ears), and the mission has failed.
//   MAKING SAFE   a hand on a charge for `workSecs`: Sam's own Space row at it ('make it safe', a sustained verb: a step, a sprint, another verb or Space /
//                 Esc lets go and the work starts over), or a teammate sent to it by the squad's 'work a thing' order (workthings.ts lists every live
//                 charge as a thing: X on it, 1 — the nearest man works it, his partner covers).
//   THE ENDS      FAILED = a charge went off — and it stays failed: the fight plays on, but the house taken afterwards is no win (roomclear.ts says so in
//                 place of its 'structure taken'). WON = every charge safe AND the room clear's own 'taken' (the house is the team's). The clock STOPS
//                 only when the run is over another way: Sam down, or the room clear's own 'wiped'. The squad down with Sam still up does not stop it —
//                 he has hands too. The row over the room clear's objective is this file's while a charge is live or one has gone off (the marker on the
//                 live charge nobody is at, the row saying who is on which); with all safe the row is the room clear's own again.
//
// LIVE = the switch on (`DEFUSE.on`) ∧ the level carries the block ∧ a room clear is staged on it ∧ no show. A level without the block: every entry point
// returns on its first line — the game as it was. No dice; the state is the clock's start, each charge's state and Sam's own work, with a snapshot / restore
// pair for a checkpoint (savestate.ts). Per-player state is asked through one accessor (who()), so a second player is one place to change.
//
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
