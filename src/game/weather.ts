// Weather (E10): a night storm over the level — rain in the lot and outside every window, lightning that throws every window's shape across the floor through the
// ordinary direct pass, thunder rolled in after the light by the distance, and a wet and glossy car park. One object on the Game (game.weather), stepped from
// Game.update; nothing here is level geometry (the interior footprint below mirrors audio.ts's own outdoors test) and nothing persists past setEnabled(false),
// which puts the boxes it touched back as they were. (The experiment's ground mist at the fire exit — a live smoke domain, +11 ms in its worst view — was cut at
// the merge by the maintainer's call; the storm touches the smoke solver nowhere now.)
//
//   RAIN       is drawn, not simulated: volumetrics.wgsl (c) evaluates a lattice of falling streaks along every view ray that ends outdoors, lit by the local
//              lights. This file only feeds it numbers through engine.weather (render/frame.ts WeatherFrame): rate, wind shear, wetness, the sky flash.
//   LIGHTNING  a stroke is ONE directional light of kind 2 added to the LightSet for a third of a second — the daylight sun's path (lighting.ts setDaylight)
//              made transient: RtLight.transient keeps it out of every accumulated signal exactly as a muzzle flash is, so the cascades / gather history never
//              see it and nothing ghosts; the history-free direct pass traces its shadow rays like the moon's, so mullions and frames print on the floor for
//              free; volumetrics march it under the roof (window shafts) and the outdoor air takes the lit-sky term. Its intensity follows a two-return-stroke
//              envelope integrated over each frame (a 20 ms pulse still delivers its energy at 20 fps). The AI is not told about it — but the light is real:
//              Sam's meter and the guards' eyes read the probe's irradiance, so a man looking his way past a window CAN glimpse him in a flash (EXPERIMENT.md
//              has the integrator's numbers: one stroke on a still man in the open is worth ~0.1 awareness, under the 0.3 it takes to make a guard say 'huh?').
//   THUNDER    scheduled at the stroke for distance / 343 s later: sfx.ts 'thunderNear' / 'thunderFar' (crack + clap + a long rolled rumble), low-passed and
//              stretched with distance, non-positional with a lean toward the bearing. It is ambience: no GameEvent, nobody hears it as anything. Now and then a
//              calm man on screen passes a remark (one bark site, a long cooldown).
//   WET LOT    while it rains the asphalt slab is darkened and flagged BoxFlag.Gloss (the glossy-floor experiment then mirrors the lamps, the bollards and the lit
//              facade in it — not the strokes, which stay out of the gloss term like out of everything with history — settings.gloss is switched on with the
//              storm and put back after), eased in over WET_SECS.

// storm, the two office footprints below, and NOTHING of the simulation touched (hearMask and airTrans answer exactly 1). With a kind set:
//   ROOFS      the no-rain footprints are the LEVEL's own ceiling slabs (roofsOf: up to four — the compound's yard and the barracks' courtyard are open sky), for the
//              rain drawn, the wet men, the rain bed in the mixer, the wind and the fog alike; the renderer gets the first two as before (weatherC / D) and the other
//              two packed in spare words of the Frame (frame.ts roofC / roofD → cardCfg.y / .z), so the Frame is the size it was.
//   FOG        one field for picture and simulation (weatherKinds.ts): composite.wgsl draws it along every pixel's ray, vol_common.wgsl thickens the lit haze by it,
//              and airTrans() below is its transmittance along a sight line — guards.ts / roomfight.ts / civilians.ts / devices.ts multiply it into the smoke
//              transmittance they already carry, so fog blinds an eye by the smoke's own thresholds (< 0.3 nothing, 0.3‥0.8 slower).
//   HEARING    rain is NOISE at the listener (it drowns SMALL sounds; a loud one is placed as in dry air: loudLen): hearMask() stretches every sound's path by 1 + WX_SIM.rainK × the very bed level the mixer plays there (full outdoors,
//              a third under a roof), and for WX_SIM.thunderSecs after a near thunder plays by WX_SIM.thunderK more. hearPath() is propagate() with that applied —
//              the one call the hearing model's consumers make.
//   LIGHTNING  was real light already: the renderer's meter and the eyes read it. A downpour simply has more of it, closer. The meter's CPU stand-in (headless
//              always) gets the stroke too, under a picked weather: strokeLight().
//   CLOUD      `Weather.cloud` 0‥1 — for whoever owns the sun and the moon to read; nothing here dims a light. By day hours.ts does (cloudLight: the light on open ground at
//              1 − 0.75 c^3.4 of the hour's own, moved from the sun to the sky as the deck closes, the disc spread and the colours greyed past half cover); the
//              night's moon is left as the level has it.
