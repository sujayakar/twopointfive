// PARTICLE RAIN — the CPU half of the experiment (exp/particle-rain; docs/review/particle-rain.html). The storm's rain today is a LATTICE of drop columns evaluated
// analytically along every outdoor view ray (volumetrics.wgsl (c)): flat cost, any density, but a streak is lit unshadowed, cannot end on the thing under it, and has no
// parallax of its own past the ray's. This adds a NEAR-FIELD layer of real GPU drops (render/particles.ts kind 'rain', shaders/particles.wgsl rainStep, particles_draw
// rainVertex) over the ground the view is looking at, and tells the lattice to stand back by as much under them (frame.weatherE → volumetrics.wgsl rainNearKeep):
//   RECYCLER  every frame it aims at N drops alive = the lattice's own column density at this rain rate × the OUTDOOR ground inside a disc of radius R round the view's
//             look-at point (capped by the tier: settings.particleRainCount), and files ONE emit record for the frame's share of births — the GPU scatters them over
//             the outdoor part of the disc itself (the 'rainDisc' shape rejects the interior / annex footprints per drop), on top of the rain slab, at terminal fall +
//             the wind; the update kernel drops them through the trace grid and the character capsules, ends each on what it meets and turns it into its splash
//             there; the splat draws lit, shadow-tested streaks and crowns and marks them reactive for the TAA. Deterministic: its own mulberry, seeds handed to the
//             records (the gameplay effects' serial is never advanced by rain).
//   DRIPS     fat slow drops off the EDGES of whatever outdoors gets rained on and stands over a drop — the roof's rim, the cars' roofs and bonnets, the van, the
//             dumpster, the lamp heads — found once from the level's boxes (edge points sampled every 30 cm: outdoors, open sky over the surface, ≥ 0.35 m of fall
//             beside it), a Poisson-ish trickle ∝ the rain rate from the ones inside the disc.
//   OFF       (settings.particleRain false — ?norain2 / the panel; it is ON by default since the merge — or no Particles, or no rain drawn this frame): nothing is filed, the rain ring drains inside a second,
//             frame.weatherE / weatherF are zero and the lattice is exactly what it was.
//   v2 (08-12, the maintainer: 'looks good but kinda flat … arkham city rain reacting to lighting, specular / refracting … wind outside and the rain respond to it'):
//   LOOK      each streak is shaded as a WATER DROP smeared over its shutter, not a grey scatterer: the update kernel scores the three strongest shadow-tested lights through a
//             drop's phase function (an isotropic floor + a forward lobe: a streak between the eye and a lamp flares, one lit from the eye's side is dim) + a strand glint (the
//             water cylinder along the streak mirrors a light where the half vector stands square to it, widened by the emitter's angular size = its energy bound), keeps LAST
//             frame's shade as the streak's TAIL (the point 15 cm up the streak was lit exactly so a frame ago: a streak entering a beam brightens along its length for free), and
//             the splat REFRACTS the scene behind the streak (the composite's copy sampled off the streak's line, depth-aware, luminance-bounded) as an 'over' by its coverage —
//             a drop over dark asphalt beside the lamp's pool shows the pool, one over an even field vanishes into it — plus per-drop length / brightness spread. PRAIN below.
//   WIND      the drops ride the WIND FIELD (game/wind.ts → the particles' wind records: the storm outdoors easing in off the facade, gusting; particles.wgsl windAir): born
//             moving with the air where they enter the slab, dragged toward it as they fall (a drop answers a gust over ~0.9 s, as a real one does), so the streaks SLANT with
//             the storm and swing with its gusts; the LATTICE far field is handed the same mean air (frame shear = −air ÷ 9 m/s, low-passed by the drops' own response) so near
//             and far lean alike; births are thinned into drifting SHEETS (a value noise carried downwind) so curtains of denser rain cross the lot.
