// BACK TO THE WALL, THE FEEL PASS (the Q hold in player.ts: wallSnap / moveOnWall / releaseWall, the pose in character.ts wallBody / stanceBody).
// One switch — WALLSNAP.on, OFF = the hold exactly as it was (every hook in player.ts / character.ts is behind it) — over three things:
//
//   QUIET (hands empty or the pistol): the TAKE runs on one clock sized to the job (a short step and a small turn = a tenth of a second, a long reach and a
//   half turn = a third), eased OUT so he moves on the frame of the key, the turn a little ahead of the glide so the shoulders come round and the back then
//   lands; the feet STEP onto the hold's spots one after the other instead of skating; the landing has a settle (the pelvis dips, the head tips back to the
//   plaster) and a soft scuff only the player hears; the reach is longer for a face he is walking AT; Q pressed a moment early still takes it. The way OFF
//   keeps his momentum: Q with a direction held walks on from the first frame, the stick held away needs a tenth of a second instead of a quarter, Q with
//   nothing held peels him a hand off the plaster and no further (he chose that shadow).
//
//   LOUD (the rifle in his hands when Q goes down): the rifle STAYS in his hands — he stacks on the wall, shoulder to it, facing along it, low ready;
//   walks along it the way he faces; a click raises it and fires where the line is clear. Parked at the open end he faces, the cursor on anything the
//   corner hides steps him out past the end with the rifle in the shoulder, and the cursor coming back steps him in again; the camera holds still through
//   the step, so the point under the reticle does not swim. No key is held for any of it.
//
//   WITHOUT THE KEY (`press`, a switch of its own under `on`): a move key held into a wall he is up against takes it, quiet or loud as above. Its key still does, where the row has one: the page's board gives it none (host/keymap.ts qFree).
//
//   HEARD AND UNHURRIED (`voice`, `slow`, each a switch of its own under `on`): the landing and the step off have a sound each; the take runs twice as long.
//
// This file is the table and its arithmetic only (nothing of the game is imported: src/game is one import cycle); the hold's code is where the hold is.
