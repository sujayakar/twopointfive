// Thin lines in the picture: a laser's beam, a tracer's streak. Each is made no thinner than about a pixel of the view the STEP ran under (Game.mPerPx) and dimmed by what
// it was widened. A picture drawn from another view than the step's — the engine replay's own camera and window over a tape recorded at another zoom or window size — needs the
// same rule asked of ITS pixel, or a beam sized for a 150-row recording is drawn as a fat pale bar on a 1000-row picture. So the makers NOTE what they made (`thinNote`: the
// line's true half-width, pixels it must cover, its light before any widening) and whoever draws from another view asks `thinFit` for a list with those boxes re-made for it.
// A weapon laser's line also carries an AIR mark (`thinAir`: its bead, or null): the renderer may then draw it as light in the air instead of as a box (settings.beamAir,
// render/passes.ts setBeams → composite.wgsl beamAir) — the box itself is never written.
// PICTURE ONLY: the note is a WeakMap beside the box, `thinFit` never writes a noted box nor the list it is handed, and nothing in a step reads either. A leaf: types only.
