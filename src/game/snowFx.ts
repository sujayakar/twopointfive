// SNOW — the flakes in the air of a level built for snow (weatherKinds.ts SNOW_LEVELS; the maintainer, 10-14: 'curate snow levels and have the art be custom').
// The snow that LIES is that level's own boxes and paint (tools/levels/pass.ts): nothing here or in any shader lays snow on a surface. What falls is drawn by the
// particle rain's machinery in another dress — the same third ring of GPU slots, the same emit record, the same shadow-tested lights and wind field — with the
// rain's own half of it untouched: a page is one level for its life, a snow level never draws rain (weather.ts hands it rain 0), and the flake's statements sit
// behind the scene prelude's `const WX_SNOW` (render/frame.ts snowConfig), dead code on every other page.
//   A FLAKE   falls at ~1.25 m/s against the rain's 9 — so it rides the AIR almost whole (drag = gravity ÷ fall: it answers a gust in a tenth of a second where a
//             drop takes most of one), sways on its own slow flutter, and lands without a splash (particles.wgsl rainStep under WX_SNOW). It is a diffuse white
//             scatterer, not water: a broad phase, no glint, nothing refracted, drawn as a soft round dot (particles_draw.wgsl rainFragment under WX_SNOW).
//   THE DISC  round the view's look-at point, as the rain's. A flake is in the air for seconds, so two things the rain never needed: what is MISSING of the
//             population is laid through the slab's whole HEIGHT at once (a fresh disc is full now, not after the first flakes have come down from the top;
//             the steady trickle enters at the top, as snow does), and a flake that leaves the disc's
//             square is carried round to the far side of it at its height (the wrap: frame.weatherE carries the disc, its lattice share 0 — or, NEGATIVE, the metres past the level's rim the snow goes on falling: SNOW_LOOK.past) — the view moves at a
//             walk or a cut and the air it comes to is already snowing.
//   NOBODY    reads any of it: no eye, ear or foot. Its dice are its own (never Math.random, never the game's die). Play under snow is play under Overcast, to
//             the run digest (tools/qa/snow-check.ts).
//   WISPS     (the switch weatherKinds.ts SNOW_LOOK.wisps; the maintainer, 10-14: 'it does need to feel more organic … wisps of blowing snow'). Spindrift: fine snow
//             the wind runs low over the open ground in streamers. A wisp is one more particle of the same ring, told from a flake by the ASPECT it is filed with
//             (2: every flake's is 1) — born in the bottom half metre over open ground inside the view's disc, and only where a GUST PATCH lies (a noise stretched
//             along the wind and carried down it: the emit kernel throws its tries until one lands in a patch, so no slot is spent on a wisp that is not born), it
//             runs with the wind field's air × its own speed, snakes on a slow crosswind meander, slides over what faces up, piles against a wall and is gone,
//             dies under a roof; it is lit by the flake's own shadow-tested lights and drawn as a long soft streak along its motion, nearly all light and hardly
//             any cover, so many of them lie over one another as a veil (particles.wgsl wispStep, particles_draw.wgsl wispVertex — every statement behind the
//             prelude's `const SNOW_WISPS`). Its three live numbers ride in the rain look's refraction slots, which a snow level never reads (refraction is off).
//             Off (the switch, or no wind): nothing is filed and every flake statement runs as it did. tools/qa/snowwisps-check.ts.
//   GRAINS    (the switch SNOW_LOOK.grains; the maintainer on the wisps on his GPU, 10-14: 'it should really feel like snow blowing around, which I think is much
//             smaller/high frequency (maybe GPU particles would be the right fit?) … chaotic fluid dynamics, not just a single static pattern that lines up with
//             the wind … fancier snow close to the character and less fancy (like the current state) outside a radius'; 'overall this should be subtle'). Inside
//             a radius of the view's middle the blown snow is thousands of fine grains, a third kind in the same ring (aspect 3). A grain's SLOT is filed with a
//             flake's life (the ring retires in order: a short-lived record would only wait behind the flakes), and in that time the GPU picks the grain up off
//             the ground, flies it a second or two and lays it down again, over and over (particles.wgsl grainStep) — carried by the AIR FIELD, a small fluid
//             simulation of the wind over the level's floor with the walls and door leaves as its obstacles (render/airField.ts; game/airSim.ts feeds it), so
//             the snow runs round a wall's end, jets through a gap and curls behind a door's edge. With them on, the wisps stand back from the view's middle
//             and ride the same air. Off: nothing is filed, no field is built, the wisps as they were. tools/qa/snowgrains-check.ts.

 *  footsteps should be proportional to the amount of force the step is putting down"). The lab's puff was a closed formula per footfall drawn inside its march:
 *  a low burst, ankle high and a foot across, that swells for half a second, breaks into lumps and is carried down the wind while it thins, gone in two seconds.
 *  HERE it is a handful of the particles' own DUST puffs in the snow's white, filed once for each kick the game lists (snowTracks.ts: a boot, a thing dragged, a

 *  MOVING AIR (particles.wgsl windAir: the storm's wind, the lee of a wall, the simulated field where it runs), which is what draws a puff out down the wind.
 *  THE FORCE sets how many lumps, how big, how fast and how long (the numbers below, each `a + b × force`). Picture only; nothing reads a puff. The book's
