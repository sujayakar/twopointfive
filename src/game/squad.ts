// Scripted guards: the runner behind Guard.script (tour beats and, later, squad drills — stack on a door, pie the opening, enter to
// points of domination). While a guard has a script the AI state machine in guards.ts is bypassed and this moves him: nav-path toward
// `goal` at `speed`, hold `face` once planted (or all the way when strafing), point gun / torch / eyes at `aimAt`, feed the animator's
// tactical layers (stance, stack side, crouch, upper mode), keep the torch attached. It writes `arrived` back so the choreographer can
// sequence on it. Deliberately small: perception, barks and shooting stay with whoever holds the script (they call say()/fireWeapon).
// Below the runner: the first drill built on it — two men clearing a room (RoomClear), driven by a plan authored per room (level.ts, or the tour's own) —
// and below that the live use of it: the lockdown pair clearing the rooms nearest the last fix (Clearing), which also runs the scripted men's senses.
