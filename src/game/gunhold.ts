// A GUN FROM BEHIND A HELD MAN (the maintainer, 10-12: "when you're holding a hostage, enemies pretty much ignore that you're shooting at them and you can just take
// them down. they should probably run for cover when you take out a gun and actively work on flanking you").
//
// What was there (guards.ts, the human-shield standoff): the men who see a colleague in Sam's arm walk a ring round the pair, 3.5‥7 m off, every ring point
// chosen so the pair stays IN SIGHT, at a walk, chest to him — and under muzzle discipline nobody fires while the man is up. Right for a knife at a throat. With
// the PISTOL at the man's head Sam fires past him: one round a man, at men standing in the open who may not answer, and suppression only roots a standoff man
// where he stands. That is the free win.
//
// The rule here, for the men of that standoff, from the moment one of them has SEEN the pistol in the hold (or a round has left it):
//   COVER   a man in Sam's line of fire, forward of his rear arc, RUNS for the nearest floor where something solid stands between him and Sam's gun (a crouch
//           behind low cover counts; glass does not), and holds there — the standoff is kept without eyes on the pair while somebody of his side has seen
//           them lately;
//   ROUND   the men go round: each plans a way to Sam's back that keeps out of his line of fire (the nav search at a price on floor his gun covers, dearest in
//           front of him), two men opposite ways, bent double behind anything low; with three or more, the man most in front of Sam stays in cover and keeps
//           him talking. A way may cross open floor in his line only in short dashes — a couple of strides with the pistol turned on this man, a longer one
//           while it is on somebody else — else it is no way: he stays behind his cover and is asked again; and a man caught in the open with the pistol
//           coming round onto him breaks for the nearest cover;
//   LOOK    with nobody's eyes on the pair for a few seconds a man in cover steps to its edge (or stands up from behind low cover), looks, and steps back; the
//           pair gone from where they were left = the standoff is lost, and it is the plain hunt on where they were;
//   LINE    a man who gains the clean line at Sam's back (guards.ts flankShot: within 70° of dead astern, the held man well clear of the round, inside 5 m)
//           plants on it — and once Sam has FIRED from behind the man, takes it: single aimed rounds on the standoff's own slow cadence. Never past a civilian,
//           never from anywhere but that line; before Sam fires the line is held silent, as it always was.
// Nothing here adds a man, a hit point or a steadier hand: the same men, walking somewhere else.
//
// ONE MODEL: where Sam is, is where a man of the side last SAW the pair (`Known.sam` — any standoff man's eyes this frame, or his own); nobody is steered by the
// pair's true position through a wall. A round from the hold is known to every man of the standoff (they are inside a room's reach of it by construction).
//
// SWITCH: `GUNHOLD.on` — ON in the page (`?nogunhold` = the ring and the silence exactly as they were), OFF in the module and on the frozen harness stand
// (`TPS_GUNHOLD=1`); a FROZEN_HOLDS row, in the knob registry and a journal's tables (a recording from before the key replays with it off). Off = nothing in this
// file runs: every seam in guards.ts returns on its first clause. Never under a show (`touring`) or `quietUtility`.
//
// STATE: per hold (`Known`, keyed by the Hold object) and per man (`St`, keyed by his Standoff record) in WeakMaps — it dies with the hold / the record, as the
// standoff record itself does; no checkpoint is written with a man in Sam's arm (savestate.ts playerBusy), so nothing here is saved. The die is the game's
// (simRandom). Seams: guards.ts standoffPerceive (gunHoldSee), standoffAlert (gunHoldFeet, gunHoldFree), standoffUpkeep (gunHoldKeeps), updateGuard's
// suppression line (gunHoldRuns). Check: `bun run tools/qa/gunhold-check.ts` (`probes.ts gunhold`; `GUNHOLD_BREAK=1` must fail).
