// A MAN FLINCHES WHEN FIRE COMES CLOSE (the maintainer, from play: 'we should have some flinching when there's fire near a character' — 'maybe also
// proportional to training too' — 'so very inexperienced characters get freaked out by gunfire and may even run away').
//   · THE FLINCH, FOR ANYBODY WHO FIGHTS: every round of a side hostile to him that passes or strikes close to a living defender, man of the night staff,
//     teammate or the player's own man ducks him off it (character.ts flinchFrom: head down and turned away from where it came from, trunk folded over the
//     gun, knees soft; both hands stay where they are, so a hand's errand — a weapon change, a keypad — goes on under it). It is fed where the round exists
//     (suppression.ts noteRound, the same closest-approach and strike distances that feed the suppression scalar, before anybody's temperament or cover is
//     weighed — and, for this alone, rounds from nearer than that model's own least travel, down to `minTravel` of the muzzle): under `least` nothing, from
//     there up to `full` the duck grows from `far` of itself to all of it. A burst is one duck, and a round on his way back up puts him straight back down
//     (the animator's own rule).
//   · BY TRAINING: the animator already makes it big and slow for an untrained body and a dip of the head for a drilled one (CharacterAnimator.trained: the
//     player and his teammates are drilled, the response team nearly). Among the defenders and the night staff a STEADY man (morale.ts trainingOf) shows
//     `steadyK` of what a GREEN man shows. So: a green man folds, a steady one ducks, an operator dips his head.
//   · IT IS THE PICTURE: nothing here touches anybody's aim, spread, cadence, reaction clock, hands or health. What the body does it does to the man's own
//     eye and muzzle, as every pose does (one model for the picture and the AI): a head ducked a hand's breadth for half a second.
//   · WHAT IT LEAVES ALONE: the suppression model's own start on the rising edge over its flinch line (the bark, the late round) is as it was. A choreographed
//     man flinches only where his script says so (GuardScript.flinch: the tutorial's men behind the trucks ask for it, and get this same duck round by round);
//     a show on the floor and the utility stages get nothing; a man in somebody's arm, a fled man, a body: nothing. A round of his own side going past him:
//     nothing (`friendly` would have it). Civilians and hostages are not walked by the round's feed and get nothing here (theirs is their own fright).
//     With the motion pass off (MOVES) there is no duck to show: the counts run, nobody moves.
//   · THE VERY GREEN MAY RUN (`run`, and only where the nerve rule and the runner are on: morale.ts, runner.ts): a GREEN defender or night-staff man kept
//     under close hostile fire — a round that ducks him no more than `hotSecs` ago — for `breakSecs` in all (the count eases back at `easeK` of a second a
//     second while the fire is off him) who is ALONE (no living man of his side who still has his gun near him in his view: morale.ts's company rule, less
//     the men who have already run) breaks: runner.ts's own sequence, started through its seam (runnerBreak) — he shouts it, holds low a beat, the weapon
//     leaves his hand and he runs for his mates or out of the building. With a mate at his shoulder he stays, flinching. A steady man never does: he ducks
//     and, pinned long enough, shifts to cover, as he did. Never a civilian, an operative, the player, the response team, a rescue's cast, a choreographed
//     man (that file's own list).
// By behaviour, never by hit points; nothing is drawn or written for the player but the man himself. No die, no wall clock: the clocks are game seconds,
// and ride a checkpoint. The switch is off in the module and on the frozen stand: with it off every seam returns on its first line and no man has a record
// here. Type-only game imports but for the functions below, used inside calls only (src/game is one import cycle).
