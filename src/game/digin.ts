// DEFENDERS DIG IN AHEAD OF THE TEAM (the harder-defenders goal; default OFF = the room fight exactly as it was).
//
// What it is: a man holding a room the team has NOT reached yet, who learns where the team is — his own ears (the room fight's `noiseAt`: gunfire, a boot, a
// charge somewhere outside his room) or a word on his side's net (the first man of a room to get eyes on the team calls it, once he is past his own reaction) —
// gets ready for them instead of standing where he stood. IT TAKES HIM REAL TIME, in steps the team can catch him at:
//   think (2–5 s) → [gather: alone in his room, run to a room of his side's that still has men, said on the net] → shout, or the room's word on the net when no
//   enemy is in earshot → the bracer runs to a chair / carton / bin,
//   hauls it to the door (0.7 m/s, scraping the whole way), pulls the leaf to, works it under the handle (4–7 s, bumps heard) → the next likeliest door the
//   same way → to cover → set. A room is all set ~15–30 s after its first word of the team; a man caught with his hands on the furniture owes more before his
//   first round (`caught`), a door opened under his hands is not wedged, and anybody in his sight ends the step he is on.
//   · WHICH DOOR: the shortest way round from the noise that does not run through his own room; the men of a room turn about between the two likeliest,
//   · WHO: as shipped the room fight's rally decides first, exactly as ever (a man who means to go to the fight next door goes) and whoever holds his room
//     digs in — the switch never takes a man off the hunt. STAY (off) makes every man who hears them hold and dig in: MEASURED, that is EASIER on a team with
//     flashbangs than today's rush (the men on the hunt are what costs it men between doors; a flashbang undoes most of a dug-in room),
//   · GATHER (off: measured, two men under one flashbang): a man alone in his room doubles up with a room that still has men (never by a way that passes the
//     noise; ≤ 24 m, the move mode's ten seconds),
//   · BRACE: the furniture is really moved (props.ts), and the wedge reuses the Door's own lock (locked against the far face, to a lock no ring fits): it will
//     not open by hand from outside — the team's door tools boot it (their own 'locked. kicking it.'), a charge blows it, a man ordered across is walked round
//     by another door if there is one, Sam gets pick / kick; staff contacts carry a key, so nobody of theirs is ever stuck behind one,
//   · DOORS: a door of his room standing open toward them is walked to and pulled shut first,
//   · COVER: he moves to the spot in the room that SEES that doorway, is not seen from outside it, has a wall at its back and is not in front of another door —
//     the far side of the opening from a mate already on it; FAR: as far back as the room lets him see it (a stun canister reaches eight metres),
//   · DEPTH: every second man of a room takes a spot OFF the door's line instead (neither the doorway nor a can gone off just inside it sees his eyes) that
//     looks onto the floor the team must cross; LEARN (off) makes that every man once their side has heard a flashbang,
//   · STEADY: a man set on a door his room wedged does not flinch when it is booted in (the room fight's startle) — he was waiting for exactly that.
// Nothing here touches hit points, dice, aim or the reaction tables; `steady` withholds one surprise beat from a man who is not surprised, `caught` ADDS one.
// Every step has a cue: their net on the HUD's log (contact called, a man falling back to another room), the shout (said only when Sam or a teammate can hear
// it), the furniture scraping (a GameEvent + the sfx, like any shoved chair; a teammate who hears it says so), a teammate stacked on a wedged door saying it
// is blocked BEFORE anybody boots it, and the boot itself.
//
// Seams (all one added line or one added clause): roomfight.ts tickDef → digInTick, rally → digInStays, reset → digInReset, evidence (the startle) →
// digInBraced, applyWatch → digInLook. Everything else lives here. The two readonly Door fields the wedge writes are put back by digInReset (Door.reset()
// restores `locked` itself). The team has been in a room: its men are the room fight's again (no fear topped up, no second dig-in there).
//
// IMPORT CYCLE (src/game is one): nothing at module level uses another game module's exports.
