// STATURE — the cast DRAWN at slightly different heights per man. The cast's meshes sit on one skeleton, so every crown, shoulder and fist lay on the same lines; this draws each man
// as a uniform scale of himself about his feet (his root on the floor), a few per cent either way, and takes everything that is drawn off his bones with him.
//
// LOOKS ONLY. The skeleton, `Character.bones`, `skel.jointData`, the hit capsules (`Character.rayHit`), eyes, muzzles, collision, sound, the lights a man carries and every Box the
// CPU ray-casts are untouched and nothing here is read back by the simulation: what moves is what the GPU is HANDED —
//   · his joint palette (a scaled copy → the raster, the mesh shadows' skin, last frame's palette for motion vectors: all read the one uploaded buffer),
//   · his shadow / reflection proxies (the round cones' ends, his own fit's radii, the cull sphere),
//   · the boxes bolted to him (rigProps through combat.ts handProps: guns, torch, goggles, holster, slung rifle, held cans): `Box.dc / dh`, which scene/boxes.ts packs and registers
//     in the trace grid in place of c / h — the Box the cursor's ray and the lasers' reach meet on the CPU stays where the simulation has it,
//   · the near end of his weapon laser (the far end stays on the simulation's hit point).
// NOT moved (the simulation's, a few centimetres from the drawn man at most): the positions of the lights he carries, where a round / a tracer / a spent case / a thrown can starts,
// bubbles and labels over his head, a wet boot's print.
//
// The table is per VARIANT of the cast (anim/gltf.ts; game/cast.ts says who wears which) + a small per-man jitter off his id (never a die). Sam is 1 exactly; with no cast loaded
// (the mannequin) everybody is 1; a man at 1 takes the code path as it was (the same buffers, no copy). While two bodies must register — a man in Sam's arm, a body hauled by the
// ankles — the held one eases to 1 and back. The eased value is presentation state: not saved, not in any digest.
