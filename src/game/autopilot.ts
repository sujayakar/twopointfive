// B IS THE SQUAD'S AUTOPILOT (AUTOPILOT.on; the maintainer, 10-13: '"B" is the "autopilot" mode where the squad does the reasonable thing (and then maybe
// briefly shows their plan and then fades out), while X is the sweatier mode where you can micromanage them a bit').
//
// The quick key (orders.ts ORDERS.quickKey) used to give the target's FIRST ROW and nothing else: move there on floor, stack up on a door, fall in on
// nothing — and 'stack up' again on a door the men were already stacked on. With the switch on it asks `autoPick` instead:
//   · floor / nothing / a teammate / a door nobody of the addressed men waits on = that first row, as ever;
//   · a door they STAND on a plain 'stack up' at (every man on his mark: a second tap while they still walk is 'stack up' again, not an entry) = THEY GO
//     IN, by the entry they pick (below) — only the men stacked on it (GiveOpts.men): a man left elsewhere is left. (AUTOPILOT.restack, the page's
//     stand: they do NOT go in — the key is 'stack up' again and a man answers that they are stacked; the word's key is the way in);
//   · a door something else of theirs waits on (an order given on the word, a threshold held, a charge set or being set) = the word, as F gives it, to
//     the men on THAT door (the pair, which has no 'go' order: its held threshold's word, or its set charge blown);
//   · a door with a set charge nobody waits on = it is blown (the tools' own row) — never one that is on a word still gathering (doortools.ts
//     onPendingWord: the key refuses that too).
// THE ENTRY, the first that the row's own `valid` takes, from only what the team knows (ONE MODEL: the far room by cleared.ts — has one of them stood in
// it —, an enemy only while the team's fog has him in sight, the door's lock only once a man has tried it):
//   1. the squad is silent (silent.ts): open and clear, and nothing else — the autopilot never makes the squad loud by itself;
//   2. an enemy in sight in the room beyond the door (the fog's own picture where there is one, else the room fight's meters) and a stun left, or a
//      room none of them has stood in and more than `keepBangs` left: bang and clear;
//   3. open (kick, pick: the row's own verb) and clear;
//   4. none of those, loud, and the door known shut: a charge — set, stood off from, and WAITING (the key, or B on it again, blows it).
// Nothing fits: the first choice is given all the same, so a man says why in the row's own words. It never throws a frag, never goes through a wall,
// never sends a second element to a second door: those need the player's intent and are the menu's.
//
// THE PLAN IT SHOWS: a quick-key order's row in the order book is stamped `auto`, and floorplan.ts draws its men for `showSecs` where the menu's own
// order has PLAN.freshSecs — the player did not pick the entry, so he is given longer to read it. `replan`: the squad's own change of plan with nobody
// asking (doortools.ts haltAt: a door found shut — they stop and stack on it) is drawn the same way (SquadOrders.shows; the module says so the frame it
// re-assigns them). THE HUD'S B LINE (autoHint) is the squad's FIRST choice in the row's own words, asked every frame, so it runs no path search and
// writes nothing: the press itself asks each row's `valid` and may fall back (a mate behind the door: no bang).
//
// PER SEAT, for a second player: the press, its cursor and `who` are the seat's (orders.ts input); nothing here keeps state.
// Off (the module's default, the frozen stand): the quick key is the first row, no row is stamped, nothing more is drawn — the build as it was.
