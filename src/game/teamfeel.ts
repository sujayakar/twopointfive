// TEAM FEEL: the room fight's feel rules, gathered for the Tab panel (ui/bindings.ts 'Team feel') and KEPT PER MACHINE. The rules themselves live where they
// act — combat.ts FLASH / LASER, guards.ts PACE / LIGHTS, nvg.ts NVG, irlaser.ts IR, fogofwar.ts FOG, doortools.ts DOORTOOLS, roomfight.ts ROOMFIGHT, orders.ts ORDERS, cover.ts COVER / REAR, entrypoints.ts ENTRY — and each
// has its old behaviour one switch away; this file only knows which of their keys are worth a row, what they shipped as, and how to keep a changed one across
// a reload (every scenario pick on the start card IS a page load, so an A/B flipped in the panel would otherwise be gone before it could be played).
//   Stored: ONLY the keys a row has changed and that differ from the shipped value (localStorage `twopointsix.teamfeel`, `{ "PACE.max": 1.8, … }`) — an
//   untouched knob follows the build's default when that moves, and a URL flag for a visit is not kept. Read back once per Game (its constructor), type-checked against the shipped value. No storage (the harness): nothing kept.
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing here is built from another game module's exports at module load — tables() and the shipped snapshot are made on first use.)
