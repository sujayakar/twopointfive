/** EVERY DEATH EXPLAINS ITSELF — the game's half (the panel is src/ui/recap.ts).
 *
 *  What it keeps: for every man of OUR side who goes down (a player, a teammate, a hostage) WHO did it, FROM WHERE and with what, plus the floor's last
 *  `RECAP.secs` seconds — every man's place and gun line, every door leaf, every round — so the end card can show how it happened.
 *
 *  THE RULE A SECOND PLAYER NEEDS: nothing kept here is handed out while anybody is still playing. `deathRecapOf` answers null until `recapOver` — the run is over
 *  for EVERYBODY — so a man who is down beside live friends never gets the shooter's place or the floor without its fog. What may be shown live is the squad's own
 *  knowledge and is not this function's.
 *
 *  THE FILE ONLY READS THE GAME. No dice, nothing written that the simulation reads: a run with the switch on is the run with it off, digest for digest
 *  (tools/qa/deathrecap-check.ts holds it), so the switch is ON on every stand and `?norecap` / the Tab row is the way back. State is per Game in a WeakMap and
 *  starts over with every fresh `g.mission` (a restart, a checkpoint load). It is NOT in a checkpoint: it is the picture of a death, and a load is a run in which
 *  that death has not happened.
 *
 *  Seams: combat.ts fireWeapon → `recapRound` (the round that is about to land on a man: one line), game.ts `recapTick` (last in Game.step), ui/debrief.ts
 *  mounts the panel. */
