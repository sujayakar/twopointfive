// A TEAMMATE LOOKS UNDER A SHUT DOOR WITH THE OPTICAL WAND — ON THE PLAYER'S ORDER, NEVER ON HIS OWN.
//
// The maintainer, 10-16, on whether a teammate may carry the wand and look first: "a, but yeah you have to order it". So this file is ONE ORDER and
// nothing else: no teammate ever decides to use a wand, no door tool has him look first, no drill asks for it. With `WAND.mate` (wand.ts) off, with
// nobody on the floor carrying one, or with no fog of war to look into, nothing here runs past its first line and the order is not on any menu.
//
// THE ORDER (id `wandLook`): the orders menu opened on a door (X, or the middle button) lists 'look under it · wand' on a key of its own, V
// (`WAND.orderKey`: every digit of a door's menu is taken and nothing is ever on a digit above 5; V is the whistle's key, eaten only while a menu that
// lists the row is up). It is ONE man's order (`only`): the nearest of the addressed men who carries a wand and can walk to the door's face they are on;
// everybody else is left exactly as he was. Greyed with the reason where it cannot be done: nobody addressed carries one, the door is steel (no gap),
// not shut, off its hinges, or nobody can get to it.
//
// THE MAN: walks to the middle of the leaf on the men's face (the player's own kneeling spot: Doors.workSpot), kneels with the lock work's pose, and
// `WAND.feedSecs` later (`WAND.quick`: as he gets down, the first time — wand.ts wandThrough) his lens is LIVE. He keeps it there until he is told something else, the leaf moves (he steps off beside the latch jamb, gun on
// the doorway), the fight takes him (the lens comes out; fed again from the start when he is back on his knee), or he is hit.
//
// THE LENS IS HIS EYE (fogofwar.ts asks `mateWandEye` in place of his own eye: no sixth eye): the player's lens by every number (wand.ts wandLens /
// wandFov / wandPanMax), swept from one end of its arc to the other and back over `WAND.sweepSecs` on the game's clock, since nobody aims it for him. So
// while he looks, what is round HIM is fog unless another eye has it — the same price the player pays. A hostile it shows keeps the wand's '(?)' mark.
// Under 'only my own eyes' it is a device feed like a sticky camera's and still lifts the fog.
//
// Nobody notices a lens; it files no sound; no dice; nothing reads the camera. No state in a checkpoint: an order is not saved (a checkpoint is refused
// with a squad on the floor), and after a load he simply is not looking.
