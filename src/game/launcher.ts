// nearly flat arc — gravity and a little drag on it — that puts a man OUT COLD if it takes him in the head, the neck or high in the chest (combat.ts killGuard's
// quiet path: 'struck', breathing, what he held laid down, a thud the room hears — the takedown at fifteen metres), STAGGERS him anywhere lower (doubled over a
// second and a half, no round from him, a yelp — and then he is alert, and knows which side it came from), and clatters off whatever else it meets as a noise the
// room goes to look at. Never lethal, never suppression (a ring is not a round: nothing here calls suppression.ts), never retrievable: a spent ring is a 'ring'
// item on the floor (throwables.ts) and the count only ever falls. Any Character may fire one (fireRing takes the shooter): Sam today off the rifle in his hands
// (player.ts: the RING attachment selected with the rifle's slot digit, let go on the right button), an operative handed the same rifle later. Rings in flight live on Game.rings; game.ts steps them right after the player and
// draws them with the items.
