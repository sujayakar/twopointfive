// EDGE LOOK — what a broken wall LOOKS like where it broke (the destruction goal's look pass: "a breach has ragged edges, rubble and scorch"). wallbreak.ts opens
// whole 0.5 m columns, so a hole or a port is drawn as a razor-straight, full-height cut with nothing at its foot. This module dresses that cut and changes
// NOTHING ELSE: the hole's real shape — the statics every ray, foot, sound path, nav cell, reach mask and smoke obstacle reads — is exactly wallbreak's.
//
// WHAT IS DRAWN (all of it `Dynamic` boxes keyed MKEY.look, handed to the frame's dynamic list like the moths: rasterised and lit, never in the collision
// lists, the nav grid, the reach masks or the smoke's obstacles — a round, an eye and a boot pass through every piece — and never met by the CPU's world ray
// (BoxWorld.raycast passes the key: the cursor's aim, an order's point, a laser's dot and a tripwire's beam land behind it, where the round goes). `NoShadow`
// as well, so no ray of light meets them either — but for the pieces that cast the shadow they draw under the cut switch: the full-thickness edge coat, the
// lintel, and the loose fragments 30 cm long and up that lie in no tripwire's line):
//   EDGES    every straight cut between a standing part and an open one (a port's two sides, a hole's sides low and high, the top of the sill a port leaves)
//            becomes ONE BROKEN LINE: control points standing far, near, far out of the cut, each stretch between two of them a plate of the wall's own sheet
//            whose outer side is that stretch and whose body runs back into the standing wall. A second, paler and thinner coat (the core) stands proud of the
//            paint here and there. On a HOLE the line reaches further in toward the top, so the gap narrows overhead: a breach under a ragged arch, not a slot.
//   LINTEL   an opening in a wall whose upper cell is at least 1.1 m tall need not run to the wall top: a band of the wall's own sheet is left across it (a
//            ragged underside) — picture only like the rest: a round, an eye and a thrown can still pass where it hangs, the opening's real top is the wall's.
//   HEADER   without a lintel: what still hangs from the wall top over a port, in uneven lengths; the TOP TRACK of the partition (a thin grey rail) straight
//            across a port, snapped and hanging from either side over a hole; a STUD left standing in a port fire chewed, bent stubs by the sides of a hole.
//   RUBBLE   board fragments at the wall's foot in the wall's own colours (paint, core, backing paper), most of them on the side the round / the blast drove
//            them to. On the frame it happens they fall from the cell that went (a short analytic arc — no contact, no sound, no event); on a checkpoint's load
//            they simply lie there.
//   SCORCH   round a BLAST's gap: soot on both faces of the wall about the opening and on the floor at its foot (four 'scorch' decals a blast-holed wall — the
//            decal ring is picture only), and the rubble a blast throws is sooted.
//
// THE RULE IT KEEPS (the look pass's hard rule): no value is taken from the lane's hash counters (every choice here hashes the breakable's index and the
// piece's own place — a look that drew from wallbreak's or destruction's counter would shift every later choice of theirs); nothing goes into the lane's debris
// pool (a chunk landing there is HEARD); no rate cap, puff or event is touched; col.raycast is READ (where rubble may come to rest) and nothing is written.
// Everything is rebuilt from wallbreak's own cells, so a reset drops it, and a checkpoint's load re-derives it (rubble at rest) — nothing here is saved but the soot's four marks, which ride the decal ring's slice.
// BOUNDED: ≤ EDGE.maxDecor standing pieces, ≤ EDGE.maxRubble fragments (the oldest go first), and both together never past what the frame's box budget has
// left. It rides the destruction switch: wallbreak calls `opened` only when a wall really opened.
