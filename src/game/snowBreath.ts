// BREATH — steam off the men's breath on a level built for snow (the switch weatherKinds.ts SNOW_LOOK.breath; the maintainer, 10-14: 'we should have steam from breaths
// in the cold levels too', and of the snow as a whole: 'it does need to feel more organic', 'ideally it looks natural').
//   WHO       every living man on his feet (or his knees) under the open sky: Sam, the team, the defenders, the civilians. Not the dead, not a man lying down (his
//             head is at the ground: `minHead`), not a man under a roof (the weather's own roof footprints — the test the flakes and the wet use), and never a man
//             the fog of war hides (nothing live may show in the fog).
//   RHYTHM    each man's own: a phase and a pace off a hash of his id, so no two breathe together — one breath every `every` seconds at rest, a little uneven breath
//             to breath. EFFORT is the one honest signal there is: his ground speed. Run and he is blown within `effortUp` seconds — breaths every `everyHard`, bigger
//             and denser — and he gets his wind back over `effortDown` once he stops. There is no stamina in the game and none is made up here.
//   A BREATH  is `puffs` small records filed across `out` seconds (a plume that leaves the mouth, not one ball): DUST puffs — the particle system's soft round
//             growing sprite, lit by the scene's own lights and the radiance cache as every puff is, carried by the wind field as every puff is — thrown from the
//             mouth along where the head faces, a little down, with a share of his own walk. The puff's drag stops it inside a hand's length. Two things tell it from
//             dust, both carried by ONE byte of the record's colour word (render/particles.ts EmitOpts.steam; shaders `steamIs` / `steamOf`): its share of the puff's
//             opacity, and that it rises where dust settles.
//   REAL STEAM (SNOW_LOOK.steam, the table BREATHSTEAM below; the maintainer, 10-20: 'the smoke from the gun muzzle is fine so maybe breath should just work like
//             that'): with the switch on a breath is not sprites at all. It is ONE source handed to the smoke solver for as long as he breathes out — the fine
//             lattice the gun's gas lives on, a source that rides his mouth and takes its velocity from where his head faces and how he walks, turn by turn — so
//             what is in the air is the solver's own gas: lit and shadowed by the volumetric pass as gun gas is (its own shadow, a lamp's shafts), carried by the
//             wind the solver takes, stirred by a man who walks through it (Game.smokeWake's shoves, and one more at head height from here), thinned and given
//             back by the fine lattice's own rule. Who breathes, when and how hard are the lines above, unchanged; off (or with no solver drawing, or past
//             `reach` from where the view looks) the breath is the puffs it was.
//   WHOSE     who breathes and when is the game's (the state: the rhythm, the counts of men and breaths); what a breath was SHOWN as — steam through the solver
//             or puffs, whose source rides whose mouth, the records filed — is the host's (`engine.hostBooks.breath`, BreathShown below): in no snapshot or hash.
//   NOBODY    reads any of it: no eye, ear or foot, no step of the game. Its dice are its own (never Math.random, never the game's die), its clock is the frames'
//             dt, and it files with its own seeds so that no other effect's births are dealt differently for it. tools/qa/snowbreath-check.ts.
