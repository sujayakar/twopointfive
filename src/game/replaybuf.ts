// THE REPLAY BUFFER: the last stretch of play, always kept (the maintainer, 10-11: "a replay system where we can always save a replay after the fact").
// Game.update's last statement hands every finished step to tick() (Game.replayTap — null on a game nobody gave a buffer: the build as it was); tick() READS the
// game and writes only its own ring: where every man stood and which way he faced, what he was doing and why (his state, the order he is on, who has his feet,
// where they are going and by which route, who his gun is on, what he said), the doors, the things in the air, the rounds and blasts and kicks (the hearing
// model's own events), the HUD's lines, the orders given. file() turns the ring into a ReplayFile (src/replay/format.ts) — the page's F7 (ui/replaykey.ts).
//
// It is a trace, not a re-simulation: nothing here can make a later frame differ (it draws no die, asks no sensor, writes no field of the Game), and a saved
// file is read without the game. A step that throws inside tick() switches the buffer OFF with one console line: a bug here must never be a bug in the game.
//
// The ring: `hz` samples a second of play, delta-coded between KEYFRAMES every `keySecs`; it is trimmed a keyframe at a time once it holds more than `seconds`
// (so its head is always a keyframe and a file needs no state from before it).
