// The optical wand: a scope on a cable, fed under a shut door to see the room behind it before anybody opens it (SWAT 4's Optiwand, Ready or Not's mirror gun,
// Chaos Theory's optic cable). A piece of KIT: a row of YOUR card (kit.ts `MemberKit.wand`, one pouch — slots.json tool `wand`), written onto the Player
// (`Player.wand`) by kitPlayer. A TEAMMATE's card can carry one too (`WAND.mate`), and he uses it ONLY on your order: wandorder.ts (the order, his kneel,
// his lens as one of the fog's eyes) — never by himself.
//
// ONE SWITCH, `WAND.on`: ON in the page (`?nowand` = the kit card has no such row and no door offers the look — the build as it was), OFF in the module and on
// the frozen harness stand (`TPS_WAND=1`); a FROZEN_HOLDS row, in the knob registry and a journal's tables. With nobody carrying one, on = off by run digest.
//
// WHAT IT IS IN PLAY. At a SHUT door in reach, with fog of war up (the squad missions and a quiet mission with a fog rung: elsewhere the picture already shows
// every room, there is nothing to look for and the row is not offered), the door's rows carry 'look under it'. It is a sustained verb like the lock pick
// (player.ts startWand / updateWanding / stopWand; interact.ts stops it on a step, Space or Esc): he kneels at the middle of the leaf, both hands on it, gun
// away, and after `feedSecs` (`quick`, the page: as he gets there) the lens is LIVE. From then, in fogofwar.ts, HIS OWN EYE IS THE LENS (`wandEye` stands in his eye's place among the fog's eyes —
// tunnel vision: his own eyes are in the scope, the teammates' still count): a point `pastM` beyond the leaf at `eyeY` off the floor, a wedge of `fovDeg`
// turned by the CURSOR (the aim point, an input) at `panRate`, never nearer than `blindDeg` to the wall the door is in — the hard corners beside the door are
// not his to see. Everything else is the fog's own model, picture and CPU alike: a level line at the lens's height, so anything standing on the floor hides
// what is behind it; a man is seen by a line to his chest or his head. No rule of its own for the dark: the fog never asked for light, and the picture shows a
// dark room dark (his goggles help as they help his own eyes: N works on his knee at the door, `WAND.nv`).
//
// WHAT HE KEEPS. A man who was in the lens when he was last seen is marked where he stood with the fog's own fading '(?)' for `markSecs` after
// (fogofwar.ts lastSeen, the HUD's alone — nobody's AI reads it). Pulling the wand out leaves no round until the gun is back up: with kit
// handling on (the page) it is drawn by hand like any kit change and the lock-out is that draw's own (kitanim.ts, about half a second for the pistol, more off
// the back for the rifle); with it off, `stowSecs`.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: nobody on the far side notices the lens; no sound is filed; the two-man recon role (a partner who scouts by himself) is parked by the maintainer; a steel fire
// door has no gap to feed it through and a door off its hinges is a doorway. No dice, no GPU read, nothing of the camera: the aim point is the frame's input.
// State is the Player's (`wand`, `wanding`): `wand` rides a checkpoint's player slice; a look under way refuses a plain save (savestate.ts playerBusy) and is
// simply not in a forced one (a fresh Player is not looking).
