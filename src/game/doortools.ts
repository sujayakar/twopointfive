//        1  hold the door until I say     WORK THE ROOM FROM THE THRESHOLD and HOLD the jambs until told what next (order id 'thresholdHold' — below)
//        2  step in once it goes quiet    the same, and they step in by themselves once the door has been quiet (order id 'threshold')
//        3  clear from outside            (order id 'outside'; it was row 4 of the tools) the door is opened and the men work the opening from Sam's side of
//                              the frame line — ONE arc from the opener's jamb out, round the front of the door and in to the far wall, a station at a time,
//                              the muzzle (and the light on it) across what each station shows of the room; the lead walks all of it, the man behind him
//                              stops two stations short — and they STAY outside until an entry order sends them in
//   5  wait for my word        the squad of four only, on the tools and on the threshold's page: a row that flips (F flips it too, with a door menu up) — a
//                              tool given with it ON stacks and waits
// WHILE A THRESHOLD IS HELD ON THE DOOR by men the menu's orders go to (thresholdHeld: the jambs manned, nobody in — either order of it), row 5 of the door's
// own menu is 'threshold held ▸' in place of 'door tools ▸' (orders.ts OrderDef.standsIn) and turns to WHAT NEXT (HELD_PAGE): 1 step in · 2 bang, then step in ·
// 3 leave it — digits 1 and 2 are the plain way in and the way in behind a bang, as on the tools — and the word's own row, on its key (F: the blind pockets
// banged, then the step in). F is that word with no menu up too, and — the pair — with any menu up.
//
// WORK THE ROOM FROM THE THRESHOLD (kind 'threshold'; `threshold(men, target, onWord)` / `thresholdHold(men, target, onWord)` + `canThreshold(target, men)`
// are the two rows' issue / valid, `thresholdOn(doorName, who?, side?, hold?)` gives it from the console or a probe, `order('threshold', …)` from a
// scenario; a room being held takes `thresholdThen('step' | 'bang' | 'leave', men, target?)` — `canThresholdThen` its valid, `thresholdTell(what, doorName?,
// who?)` the console's):
// the men stack a man on each jamb, the door is opened, and NOBODY goes in — the two jamb men hold their diagonals across the room, still, and shoot who comes
// to the noise, everybody else keeps the squad's back; when it has been quiet the floor no lit muzzle has been across — the blind pockets — is banged (cans off
// the same count, not thrown by the first man in); behind the last burst they STEP IN SHALLOW, and from there it is the entry every other tool ends in.
// TWO WAYS OF IT, both orders: the plain one goes on by itself once the door has been quiet; given to HOLD, the jambs are held — whoever comes to the door
// still shot — until Sam says what next: step in, bang the pockets and step in (the word — F — is that one), or leave the door.
// Never automatic; with it not ordered nothing of it runs (the DOORTOOLS.thr* knobs say what was measured and what is a guess).
//
// CHARGES AND BANGS ARE COUNTED per run (a staging of the squad): DOORTOOLS.charges / .bangs, shown on the rows and on the squad's HUD block; a row with none
// left is greyed. The night breach's F drill takes its stun canister from the same count. Sam's own canisters (slot 4) are his own, as ever.
//
// What this module does and does not own. It moves men ONLY through orders.ts (SquadOrders.assign: one assignment per stage — a man re-ordered by anything else
// is no longer this module's, found by his assignment no longer being the one it handed him), and it never fires a round: who a man shoots at, from the stack,
// from a slice station or inside the room, is the room fight's (roomfight.ts, through GuardScript.over). It never touches a defender's hold / pinned / facing.
// The door is opened with the game's own verbs (doors.ts kickIn; the keyed shove squad.ts RoomClear uses), the stun canister is a real item detonated by
// combat.ts detonateStun (the men of the entry kept off its list, heads turned, as the breach drill does), the charge's effect on men is the same dazzle that
// rule applies plus a knock-down ('struck': out cold) inside `knockM`. Stack marks are orders.ts stackPosts (geometry: every door, either face) — the F drill
// keeps its authored marks on the one door it knows. Every stage is capped: a man who never arrives does not hang the order.
//
// ORDERS FROM A SCENARIO (the hostage rescue's F — rescue.ts). `order(kind, men, door, side, gate)` gives one of the entry orders for Sam without the menu
// (nothing in the order log, nothing said for Sam); `together()` makes a GATE that two or more of them share: nobody opens his door until every order on the
// gate is stacked (and, made with `go` false, until somebody raises it); a door that only needs a shove waits for a boot elsewhere on the gate and opens on the
// frame it lands (two boots on one gate each start their walk-up when the gate opens and land on their own count); an open and clear beside a bang and clear (no can for that door) goes in when the men behind
// the can do, not ahead of the flash; the men of one order are not blinded by another's can; while it stands stacked a gated order waits on a man the fight
// has on his way, and a lead lost there is replaced on the frame before anything opens. `order()` asks what the menu asks (floor at a jamb, a way there for
// each man, not steel and locked). `linked`: doors whose set charges blow on ONE trigger. `lights`: a scenario's own weapon-light switch for men going in. Where a door's jambs have no floor, the stack and the stand-off take the marks a scenario registered for that face (orders.ts
// doorMarks — a fallback: never read where the geometry has an answer). With no gate, no link and no marks this module runs exactly as it did.
//
// With no operative on the floor nothing here runs (tick: a pass over the guard list and a return; the rows are orders.ts's, inert with it).
// (src/game is one import cycle: nothing below is built from another game module's exports at module load.)
