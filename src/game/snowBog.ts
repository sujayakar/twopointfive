// THROWN THINGS BOG DOWN IN LYING SNOW (the maintainer, 10-15, from his play of the pass: "grenades shouldn't roll around as much in the snow"). THIS ONE IS
// PLAY, not picture: where a grenade, a can, a dropped magazine or a rifle let go comes down on lying snow it keeps little of its bounce and little of its
// slide, and stops where a thing on a hard floor would still be skidding. So it is the game's own switch (SNOWBOG.on: ON in the page, `?snowbog=0` off; OFF
// in the module and on the frozen stand, TPS_SNOWBOG=1 — every frozen digest of a throw on a snow level was recorded on the bounce as it was), a recording
// carries it, and nothing here reads the picture (render/snowField.ts is the PICTURE's bake and may be off): where snow lies is asked of the level's own data.
//
// WHERE SNOW LIES, for the game: on a snow level (weatherKinds.ts snowLevel), under the open sky (weather.ts underRoof — the level's roofs), at the ground (a
// landing on a desk or a roof is as it was), and not where the level's floor says otherwise: a thin lay of trodden snow (the road) bogs by `packed`, of old
// snow by `old`, and any other thin lay (swept earth, a doormat) is bare ground — the same reading the picture's bake makes of the same boxes.
