// roof. composite.wgsl draws it along every pixel's ray (common.wgsl wxFogTau) and the men's eyes are cut by exactly it (weather.ts airTrans → guards.ts). So both
// read the SAME numbers the fog is QUANTISED into the 32 bits the renderer gets (packFog), and the simulation uses what unpackFog hands back.

// Snow is not a weather laid over a level: it is the weather OF a level built for it — its ground, drifts, caps and paths are that level's own boxes and paint
// (tools/levels/pass.ts), and this file only says which levels those are, by name. On one of them, with the switch on, the Weather is born in the kind 'snow'
// (weather.ts levelKind) whatever the URL's ?weather= says; the page compiles the flakes' half of the particle shaders (render/frame.ts snowConfig → the scene
// prelude's `const WX_SNOW`). `SNOW.on`: ON in the page (`?snow=0` = such a level under the weather any level has), OFF in the module and on the frozen harness
// stand (`TPS_SNOW=1`). No other level reads any of it.
export const SNOW = { on: false };

// something like that? the rectangles don't seem to work. and i think we can make the material seem much cooler / feel like freshly fallen snow. and maybe we can
// even use the smoke sim for wisps of blowing snow?'). PICTURE ONLY, both: nothing in the simulation reads either word, and the level's boxes (what a boot, a round
// and a ray meet) are the ones the file has. `on`: a snow level's lying snow is ONE SURFACE (render/snowField.ts bakes the level's placed snow into a height field;
// shaders/snow.wgsl shades it and raises its drifts as a mesh) instead of painted boxes. `wisps`: the wind runs fine snow low over the open ground
// (game/snowFx.ts). ON in the page (`?snowlook=0`, `?snowwisps=0`), OFF in the module and on the frozen stand (`TPS_SNOWLOOK=1`, `TPS_SNOWWISPS=1`).
// `tracks` (10-14, his "deforms with character movement"): boots press a trail into the lying snow (game/snowTracks.ts; ?snowtracks=0, TPS_SNOWTRACKS=1). `glow`
// (his "maybe even has some subsurface scattering"): lamp light wraps past the terminator on snow and comes out bluer (the lighting shaders; ?snowglow=0,
// TPS_SNOWGLOW=1). Both picture only, both only where `on` draws the surface.
// `sparkle` (10-14, his "rdr2 has some nice \"sparkle\" on the snow on the ground"): on lit fresh snow a sparse set of grains each holds an ice facet that flashes
// when it mirrors a lamp to the eye, so the points come and go as the view moves (composite.wgsl, in the glow's light loop; ?snowsparkle=0, TPS_SNOWSPARKLE=1).
// Picture only, only where `on` draws the surface.
// `breath` (10-14, his "we should have steam from breaths in the cold levels too"): every living man standing under the open sky breathes out a small puff of steam
// on his own rhythm (game/snowBreath.ts; ?snowbreath=0, TPS_SNOWBREATH=1). Picture only; it needs a snow level and nothing else (not `on`: no surface is read).
// `steam` (10-20, his "the smoke from the gun muzzle is fine so maybe breath should just work like that"): that breath is real gas in the smoke solver — a source on
// each breathing man's mouth, on the fine lattice the gun's gas lives on — in place of the puffs, so it is lit, shadowed, blown and stirred as smoke is
// (game/snowBreath.ts BREATHSTEAM; ?breathsteam=0 = the puffs, TPS_BREATHSTEAM=1). Picture only; it needs `breath`, a snow level and a solver that is drawing.
// `grains` (10-14, on his GPU look at the wisps: "it should really feel like snow blowing around, which I think is much smaller/high frequency (maybe GPU
// particles would be the right fit?) and I love the way the snow dances around with stuff that feels like chaotic fluid dynamics, not just a single static
// pattern that lines up with the wind ... fancier snow close to the character and less fancy (like the current state) outside a radius"; "the nice thing of
// integrating with the fluid system is that you'll naturally get neat interactions where the wind hits a wall", "like vortices past the edge of the door";
// "overall this should be subtle"): near the view's middle the blown snow is thousands of fine GRAINS carried by a small fluid simulation of the wind over the
// level's floor — walls, boxes and door leaves its obstacles (render/airField.ts, game/airSim.ts, game/snowFx.ts updateGrains; ?snowgrains=0,
// TPS_SNOWGRAINS=1). Picture only; it needs a snow level and nothing else. The wisps stand back inside the grains' radius and ride the same air.
// `blast` (10-15, on his GPU: "grenades/he don't seem to really affect snow"): a blast over lying snow blows a crater into it, throws the loose snow about it up
// and out and shoves the wind's simulation (game/snowBlast.ts; ?snowblast=0, TPS_SNOWBLAST=1). Picture only; every blast the destruction feed tells, alike.
// `oneAir` (10-15, after tuning the pass on his GPU: the blown grains "look like the flakes but seem to behave differently. we should probably just unify those
// systems … it feels a bit weird with the flakes falling down and then the blown grains near the ground behaving so differently in a way that makes the air not
// feel physical as a fluid"; the wisps "are something else that we should think of physically. they're the wind blowing small [snow] particles that are near the
// surface, and then when the wind isn't strong enough, they fall back to the ground. so, they should show up when the wind is sufficiently strong"): ONE SNOW IN
// ONE AIR. Every flake falls through the simulated wind field among the walls and the open wind over them (particles.wgsl snowAir); the grains are no kind of
// their own (none is filed); a wisp is snow lifted off the ground only where the air over it is fast enough, carried at that air's own speed, gone where it slows
// (SNOWWISPS.liftLo / liftHi); a flake that lands in such air skips on (SNOWFX.skid). ?snowair=0, TPS_SNOWAIR=1. Picture only; needs the air field (?air).
// `marks` (10-15, his play of the pass: "pushed objects (like the chair) should impact the snow", "all physics objects can affect the snow", "it does look like a
// decal just getting splatted on ... animated a bit? or some GPU particles", "dependent on force"): every thing that moves over lying snow marks it (a pushed
// chair's legs, a rolling grenade, a slab of debris: game/snowMarks.ts), a mark FORMS (its floor sinks in over a moment, what it threw lands after) and kicks
// loose snow up, all by how hard it was made (game/snowTracks.ts stampMark; ?snowmarks=0, TPS_SNOWMARKS=1). Picture only; wants `tracks`.
// `past` (10-17, his play of the pass, of a view by the level's edge: "snowfall missing from bottom left of image"): the snow goes on FALLING past the
// level's rim. A flake high in the air is drawn well off its own ground, toward the camera's foot, so with the rim on the camera's side the flakes that
// would show over the picture's near part are ones in the air past the rim, and there were none: flakes were born, kept and drawn only inside the world's
// rectangle. With it the flakes' space is the view's disc out to SNOWFX.past m past the rim (game/snowFx.ts flakeOpen; particles_common.wgsl snowPast /
// flakeOpen). Nothing lies out there: the ground past the rim stays the dark it is. ?snowpast=0, TPS_SNOWPAST=1. Picture only.
// `under` (10-19, a review of the rule that hides a flake from a surface under a roof): the rule drew each roof's rectangle in by itself, so the seam where two slabs
// of one building meet was open to snow in the doorways on it, and it opened EVERY wall's top, the partitions' inside a building too. With this on a surface is
// under the roofs when it is a wall's thickness inside them on every side, whichever slab, and a top takes the snow only near the roofs' edge: the outer walls'
// (particles_common.wgsl flakeHidden, the prelude's SNOW_UNDER; ?snowunder=0, TPS_SNOWUNDER=1). Picture only.
