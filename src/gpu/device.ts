// of worker threads in its GPU process (15 workers on 16 hardware threads), and that pool is SHARED with Chrome's own drawing of the page: Skia Graphite rasterizes the
// HTML (the HUD, the cards, the menus) through Dawn and makes its little pipelines on the same workers. On D3D12 a big kernel of ours is a DXC compile of 5–25 s (the
// gathers, the march, the composites: everything in them is inlined into one function), so a burst of twenty of them holds every worker for that long — and Graphite's
// pipelines, asked for while the burst runs, wait behind it. The page then cannot be drawn at all: the trace of a played floor showed the raster's flush blocked 3–7 s at a
// time while the second (cut-box) set compiled after the boot, the picture frozen with it (15 s in one take). Metal compiles in a fraction of that, so the burst never
// starved anything on a Mac. So every …Async creation goes through this queue: at most `boot` in flight while the start card counts the boot's pipelines in (biggest module
// first, so the slowest compiles are not the last to start), and after the boot (`pipeQueue.settle()`, main.ts) at most `after` in flight, of which at most `low` are the
// background set's (modules compiled behind the cut prelude: `const CUT_BOXES: bool = true;`) — first come first served among the rest, so a pass's first-use pipeline
// is not stuck behind twenty background twins. A switch of the page, not a rule of the game (no knob, no FROZEN_HOLDS row: every stand compiles the same programs, only
// in a different order); `?pipequeue=0` = every creation straight to the browser, as it was.

// the background set is ready later (on the software adapter the page tools run on it was not in 21 minutes after the page was), and the first use of a pass waits its
// turn. So a Mac and the tools get every creation straight to the browser, as they always did, until the queue is measured there. `?pipequeue=1` = on wherever the page
