// die it displaced on `.sys`, and the systems that are NOT the simulation — the mixer's rate jitter and noise beds (audio/), the smoke solver's per-frame emitter
// jitter (smoke/smoke.ts) — draw through sysRandom(): under a recording they leave the seeded stream to the game alone (a replay has no mixer or solver to draw),
// while a plainly seeded Math.random (the capture recipes' determinism checklist, the harness) still reaches them exactly as it always did.
