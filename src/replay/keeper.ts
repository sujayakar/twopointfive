// THE KEEPER: one page visit's tape written out as it is played (kept.ts has the format, keepstore.ts the store). Every `KEEP.secs` the page calls beat(): what the
// replay ring and the run tape gained since the last beat is taken as a piece (game/replaybuf.ts since() — a few slices, asked between two steps), made a line of
// JSON, gzipped and put in the store; flush() does the same at once and without the gzip, for a page that is going away. Nothing is asked of the player and
// nothing is sent anywhere. A visit is filed only once it has been PLAYED (`played()`: the game has stepped in the player's hands — a title page left running its
// attract reel keeps nothing); from then on every piece is, the reel included.
// The keeper only reads its source. No game code is imported: the source is the buffer's two methods, the head a callback.
