// THE ENGINE REPLAY: a saved replay (F7) played back on the GAME PAGE itself — the real renderer, the real mixer — by walking this page's own game through the
// file's RUN TAPE (game/runtape.ts: the die, the page's query, the knob tables, then per step the dt, the player's input, the camera and every value the game read
// off the GPU). The 2D viewer (replay.html, src/replay/viewer.ts) draws the file's TRACE and jumps anywhere at once; this one runs the simulation again, in a
// straight line, so what is on screen and in the speakers is the game. Notes typed here are the file's own notes (format.ts ReplayNote, kept on the shelf row): the
// 2D viewer shows them and the other way round.
//
//   /?playtape=<shelf id>            a replay on this browser's shelf (F7 puts them there; the 2D viewer's and this page's ids are the same)
//   /?playtape=<path or url>         a replay file served beside the page (.json or .json.gz) — the shipped sound tours, tapes/…
//   &at=<step>                       start there (run forward unseen and unheard to that step first)
//
// HOW IT STANDS THE GAME: the page is first sent to the TAPE'S OWN QUERY (`recipe.search`: level, mission, squad, hour, weather, every switch the visit had) with
// its seed, so the boot is the recording's boot; then the tape's knob tables and kit cards are laid over whatever this machine keeps, before the level is loaded,
// before and after the game is stood, round the mission's staging and once more at the first step (tools/qa/rerun.ts does the same headless: keep the two in step; the WALK over the tape's rows is one file
// both take, tapewalk.ts).
// While it plays nothing but the tape reaches the simulation: the game is handed an input and a camera OF THE TAPE'S (never the page's keyboard, mouse or view
// size), and `Game.sensors.read` answers from the tape (the GPU is still asked, and not listened to). The picture is drawn through the page's own camera on the
// tape's pose with the window's own aspect.
//
// THE PICTURE'S CAMERA CAN BE TAKEN OFF THE PLAYER'S VIEW, paused or playing (`free`): a drag on the picture moves it over the floor, a right drag (or Shift +
// drag) turns and tilts it, Ctrl + the mouse — moved or dragged — turns it as Ctrl does in play (host/loop.ts: 0.006 rad a pixel, no tilt), the wheel zooms, W A S D slide it; turned or zoomed only it still follows the recorded look-at point, once moved it stays where it was put. The
// bar's 'Player view' (C) is the recording's camera again. Only the page's camera moves: the game is still handed the tape's camera every step, so the run it
// plays is the same run (the page check holds the men's places with the camera thrown about). A click that did not drag is still a note at that spot. A seek
// backwards (a page load) keeps the camera where it was put.
//
// THE FOG OF WAR CAN BE TAKEN OFF THE PICTURE (the bar's 'Fog', F; drawn as recorded until asked; only on a tape played under the fog): Game.fogLift / fogBack
// round each draw hand the renderer everybody and everything, and the HUD an open floor — between two steps, so the run is the same run (the men's places hold).
//
// NIGHT VISION IS THE VIEWER'S TO FLIP (the bar's 'NV', V; the replay opens with the goggles as the run had them, and every press flips the picture — a press that
// lands back on what the run has is 'as played' again and follows the tape from then on): the PICTURE's tube only (`settings.nvAmount`, eased here on the wall's
// clock so it works paused) and, through Game.fogLift's second argument, the infrared lines a tube shows — the run's own lasers of men whose goggles are down,
// added or left out for this draw. The player's goggles, his kit strip's word and everything a step reads (`Player.nv / nvAmount`) are the tape's, untouched.
//
// THE BAR IS A TIMELINE AND THE CORNER HAS A MAP (minimap.ts draws both). The line carries what the file's trace says happened when — rounds, blasts, orders,
// restarts, page errors, the notes — and is dragged to scrub: the seek is made when the button comes up (forward = run there unseen; back = the page again from
// that step, so it costs a boot). The map in the bottom right is the floor from the file with the men and doors of the game AS IT IS PLAYING HERE (not the
// trace's: a run that has parted from its recording shows where its men really are), the picture's camera, and the trace's rounds of the last second; a click (M)
// opens it large with names, and a click on the large one sends the picture's camera to that spot of the floor.
//
// DOES IT MATCH: after every step the men's places are held against the file's trace (the sample taken at that step), as rerun.ts holds them; the bar says the
// moment they part by more than `TOL` and goes on playing. What cannot match: a run with a showcase or the attract reel in it (they move the game outside a
// step), a tape from another build of the game or the level, a boot switch this machine pins from its own store (cut boxes, the glass fracture const).
// AFTER A SEEK the smoke in the air and the particles are not the recording's (they are stepped per drawn frame; a seek draws nothing): picture only.
//
// Nothing here is read by the game: no table, no knob, no state a step reads. The page without ?playtape never calls into this file past `tapeFromUrl`'s first line.
