// THE KEPT TAPES' FORMAT — every run kept in the browser with no key pressed, and the one file a set of them travels as (the page wrote that file itself until
// 2026-10-27; tools/cloud/pull.ts writes it from a hosted build's backend, and tools/qa/replay-dump.ts reads it).
// (the maintainer, 10-11: "maybe a good model would be that we save all replays as we go (in browser storage?) and then i can just periodically dump all of them to
// you (and you dedup?) … without me needing to do a bunch of explicit curation")
// A page visit's tape is kept as PIECES: every few seconds the page hands over what the replay ring and the run tape have gained since the last piece
// (game/replaybuf.ts since()) and the piece is written to this browser's own storage (keepstore.ts). Pieces laid end to end are the whole visit — every run made on
// that page load, however long — where an F7 file is the ring's last five minutes. A DUMP is those pieces as lines of JSON, one line a record (`KeptLine`), gzipped
// in members that simply follow one another (so the page never has to hold or re-pack the whole thing):
//   {k:'dump'}   once, first: what the file holds
//   {k:'head'}   a visit's head (build, page query, level, switches, floor) — written with its first piece and again whenever it changed; the LAST one stands
//   {k:'piece'}  one piece, numbered from 0 within its visit
//   {k:'notes'}  notes put on a kept visit in the viewer
//   {k:'f7'}     a file saved by the key that the shelf holds: its notes and which visit it is a window of (the trace itself is in the visit's pieces)
//   {k:'file'}   a whole replay file the shelf holds whose visit is NOT kept here (saved before the page kept tapes, or its visit has been let go)
// `assemble` turns one visit's head and pieces back into a ReplayFile — the very thing F7 writes, so the viewer, tools/qa/replay-at.ts and the re-run read it as
// they read any other. No game code is imported: the viewer page and the reading tool (tools/qa/replay-dump.ts) load this file alone.
