// THE REPLAY FILE (the maintainer, 10-11: "a replay system where we can always save a replay after the fact and then a viewer where i can annotate bugs").
// A replay is a TRACE of what happened — who stood where, facing what, doing what, on which route; the rounds, the doors, the words — sampled off the running game
// by game/replaybuf.ts and saved after the fact (F7 on the game page). It is NOT a recording the simulation is run again from (that is the session journal, F10 —
// game/journal.ts — which must be started before the thing happens and refuses a squad on the floor): nothing here is re-simulated to be read, so a replay opens
// on ANY later build, whatever has happened to the level, the doors or the save format since. The viewer (replay.html → src/replay/viewer.ts) draws it as a map
// with a scrubber and takes NOTES — a moment, a spot, words — which are kept IN the file; tools/qa/replay-at.ts reads file and notes in a thread.
//
// No import from the game: the viewer page and the bun tool read a file with this module alone.
//
// SHAPE. `samples` are taken `hz` times a second of PLAY (a paused game adds none). Each carries `r` = seconds on the replay's own clock (the sum of the steps
// played since the page booted: it never goes back — a restart or a checkpoint load does not rewind it), `t` = the game's clock then, `n` = how many game steps
// had run. Everything else in a sample is DELTA-coded against the samples before it, back to the last KEYFRAME (`k: 1`, one every few seconds, and always the
// first of a file): `m` = the men who moved, `x` = the men whose doing changed, `d` = the doors that moved; a keyframe lists every man and every door there is.
// A man is named by his index in `cast` (append-only: a restart's new men are new entries). decode() below unfolds all of it into plain per-sample tables.
