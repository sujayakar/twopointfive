// THE KEPT TAPES' STORE: where the pieces of every page visit's tape live in this browser (kept.ts has the format and why), what is let go when the room runs
// out, and the DUMP — everything kept, as one file to hand to a thread. IndexedDB, a database of its own (the F7 shelf's is not touched), three stores:
//   `visits`  one small row a page visit: when, what, how many pieces, how many bytes, how many of them an earlier dump already carried, notes put on it
//   `heads`   the visit's head line as it stands (rewritten only when the switches or the floor changed)
//   `pieces`  [visit, number] → the piece's line, gzipped where the browser can (a Blob), the plain text where it was written as the page was going away
// Every call resolves: a browser without IndexedDB, a private window or a full disk is a store that says it did not keep it — the game is never held up.
// NOTHING HERE TALKS TO A NETWORK: a dump is a file the browser downloads, and the player attaches it where he likes.
// A memory twin (`memoryStore`) stands in under bun, where the headless check lays the same pieces through the same code.
