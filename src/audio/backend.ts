// that is the GAME's — the voice budget (cull / steal), the propagation through the walls (col.sound.propagate), the ambience emitters' placement and levels, the reverb sized by
// the traced free path, the footstep material — and drives one of these: `WebAudioBackend` (src/audio/webaudio.ts: today's graph, node for node) in the browser; the seam was cut for a native
// host that has since been removed. Types only + the buffer stand-in the SFX synth renders into.
