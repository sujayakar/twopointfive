// THE SCORE, LEVEL BY LEVEL. The maintainer, 10-15: "we should curate the music for each level, not do it randomly". So every level has a short list of the score's pieces
// (pieces.ts) written down for it here — two: the one that opens it and the one that follows — and music.ts plays that list in its order instead of dealing from a
// shuffled bag: the first piece opens the level when play begins (off the menu, or on a page that loads straight in), the second takes over once a piece has had
// MUSIC.minutes at a calm phrase end, and round again. A retry keeps the music it has. The theme is on no list: it is the main menu's alone.
//   MUSIC.byLevel  the switch (pieces.ts): ON in the page (`?shuffle` = the shuffled bag, as it was), OFF in the module and on the frozen stand (TPS_MUSIC=1 raises it with
//                  the pieces). The listener's ears only: no rule reads it.
//   the key        a level's file name without `.json` ('office' = the bundled level), and before it `<level>:<kind>` for a mission kind that wants its own on that level
//                  (the office holds four kinds of mission: the solo night's slow lean is not a rescue's clock).
//   a new level    is a row here: tools/qa/music-check.ts ('every level') is red on a mission with no row, a row for no level, a row that is not two pieces, the theme on one.
// A level typed by hand that has no row (a test yard; the editor's own document under `?level=local` is read as the office) plays SETLIST_ELSE. Names, not indices: PIECE_NAMES is read when a list is asked for, never at module load.
