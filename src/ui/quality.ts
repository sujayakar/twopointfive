 *  took on in a calm scene — that reading replaces the other and stands `backSecs`. So a machine the model underprices tries it once, reads the price, and leaves it. Where it does not

 *      shorter → the pixels go straight back to where the chain began, with the failed-rung marks it left, and that rate is this page's pace; shorter by `probeGain` (a missed vsync
 *      bought back is a whole refresh: a fifth of the frame at the least; less is the rate's own wobble) → it was the pixels, the cut is kept and the level it left is a failed rung
 *      (the way back up does not walk into it again seconds later). No step up while such a cut waits for its verdict. One that proves nothing by the end of its trial goes back to
 *      where it started with no pace learnt, the next held off as a failed rung is; and after a judged take-back the next comes no sooner than the re-test would (`probeUntil`,
 *      recheckSecs doubling — a rate that wobbles in and out of its pace is not cut every time it does);

 *      scale under the tier's start comes back a grid step at a time on the frame's own room (the union priced at the step, `gain` on top, still 6 ms inside the frame) — each step judged
 *      on its first window as as-now's give-back is: the frame grew → the step comes off, is held off as a failed rung, and the pace is forgotten;

 *      window forgets the pace and any cut being judged (the hold-offs and the failed rungs stand).
 *  Known limits: the proof needs the union to FIT, so a fight that starts on a held page before its pace is known, or a re-test that lands inside one, is cut as before and stays cut
 *  until the fight is over (the floor cannot bring 23 ms under 10.7). Load that arrives at the very rate the page was held to with no fast second between (a hold lifting mid-fight on a
 *  fixed 60 Hz display) waits for the re-test, as under as-now. And every 'proof' here rests on HOLD.pacedMs: a machine whose frame runs more than 6 ms over its union by itself reads as
 *  held — the judged steps are what bound the damage there; and a frame rate that wobbles 15 % a second by itself can read as a cut that helped (a step under the tier's start then

 *  (a machine that only just holds low goes to the floor beside such a fire); and 17 to 32 % of verylow, whose whole per-pixel part is 1.0 model-ms on the scale floor: it
 *  cannot be paid there. So the rung that keeps its own smoke (`smokeOwn`: verylow, the floor, where the smoke is the last thing the ladder sheds — SMOKE KEEP below) draws the
 *  fire without its smoke; every rung above keeps it and the scale pays. NOT a game rule: the source is look-only and its foot is over a standing man's head (the fire's notes:
 *  lines at 1.7 m and under kept all their light with the plume and without), but in the page a sight line over 1.9 m beside a fire reads the plume on low and up and none on
 *  verylow. None of it timed on a GPU.
 *  UP FROM THE FLOOR THE SHED STANDS ONE RUNG (fireSmokeFor): the hop verylow → low is priced off a frame measured with no fire smoke, so a low that put the smoke back
 *  would find itself 0.5 to 0.95 ms short beside a fire, fall to the floor, find room again and hop — the plume coming and going each time. So while AUTO moves the
 *  preset, the rung straight above a shedding one keeps the shed it arrived with; the smoke is back from the rung above that (medium, where the scale has the room) or
 *  when a preset is put on by hand. A machine that came DOWN to low keeps its smoke there. */
