// A TUTORIAL MISSION'S CARD — a lesson step's `explain` (scene/scenarios.ts LessonStep; the view's `lesson.rails.card`).
//
// The maintainer, playing the squad mission, 10-22: "i think this needs more explanation for the systems. maybe even a modal that pauses the game and
// explains it. like 'You can shoot through windows, and it's often safer to clear a room from the outside rather than going in immediately' and then the
// player can try it out". One line low in the middle says what to press; it cannot say WHY, and some of the game's rules are not seen by pressing a key
// (a round goes through a door; a window is a way to clear a room). So a step may carry a card: a heading and a few sentences, up in the middle of the
// picture the moment the step comes up, with the world held still behind it — the page's hold (main.ts: one term of the loop's `frozen`, as under the pause
// card), so no tick runs and the step's own beat plays out only once the card is closed. Enter, Space or a click on its block closes it; then the step's
// line is the instruction, and the player tries it.
//   · THE PAGE'S, NOT THE GAME'S: the game only says what the step's card is (`view.lesson.rails.card`, the step's own data). Which cards have been read is kept HERE,
//     so no snapshot, checkpoint or replay holds it and no run moves by it. A headless run never makes one and is never held; a page a script steps
//     (`__runFrames`) is not held either — the card is drawn and goes with Enter or with its step.
//   · ONCE A PAGE: a card that was closed is not shown again on this page — not after a checkpoint put back, not when the mission is started again. A
//     reload shows them again.
//   · THE KEYS are asked of it by the game's Input, ahead of the game (main.ts, Input.keyVeto), so the Enter or Space that closes a card is nobody else's
//     press — and for the first ARM_MS a card is up they close nothing: the tap that finished the last step is not the one that puts this away unread. Esc is
//     the pause card's, as everywhere.
//   · KEYS in brackets are drawn as key caps, the same way the step's line is (ui/overlay.ts hands in its own `caps`).
// Plain DOM in the HUD's layer (#railcard, made here); its rules are in index.html beside the line's (#railprompt). It is the tutorial's frame's
// `?cards=0` alone leaves the cards out of a tutorial mission (main.ts).
