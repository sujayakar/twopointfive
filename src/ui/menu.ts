// start mode is the older card (Missions · Start, the short list, the notes, the controls list, the sandbox row), unchanged.
// PAUSE (Esc): the run's name and Resume / checkpoint / Restart / Options / Run so far / Quit down a narrow card; 'Run so far' opens the debrief of the run as
// it stands beside the menu (ui/debrief.ts). DEBRIEF: the mission's card proper — up on mission complete (Again / Keep playing) and, a beat after Sam drops, as
// the down card (Restart): the rating word and score, the numbers, the badges, the floor map with his path and the pins, the timeline. While any of them is
// open main.ts freezes the simulation and keeps rendering the frozen frame underneath. Plain DOM, styled in index.html (#menu…) with ui/theme.ts's tokens.
