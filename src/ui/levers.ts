// THE DIFFICULTY LEVERS' ROWS (the maintainer, 10-10: 'let's actually unbundle difficulty a bit now since i think we'll need some play testing' · 'so fog of
// war has three rungs' · 'can have other levers for enemy ai and kit etc.'): one row per lever of game/difficulty.ts LEVERS — its label, a button per rung,
// and the line that says what the lit rung does — put on the screens a mission is set up on BEFORE it starts: the mission list's sheet (ui/missions.ts,
// under its Standard | Hard row) and, where the loadout is a screen of its own (?cards), the loadout (ui/loadout.ts: a short-list row opens there).
// Standard | Hard puts every lever on that level's rung; a lever's own button moves that lever alone and is kept on this machine (setLever) — and a lever
// put back on the rung the level has for the mission shown is let go of again. What is lit is READ OFF the game's tables (leversShown), so a row moved
// under a lever by hand in the Tab panel shows as no rung lit.
//
// ON A QUIET MISSION'S ROW (game/quietfog.ts — the maintainer, 10-11: 'i think we should make it part of the fog of war difficulty slider'): `paint(…, quiet)`
// shows the fog lever with one more rung at the bottom, OFF, and it reads and moves the quiet missions' OWN pick (quietFog / setQuietFog), never the squad
// lever. The button is made only while the rule is on (QUIETFOG.on) and shown only on a quiet row. Under the fog row there, while sticky cameras are in the
// build (STICKY.on), ONE more row, Sticky cameras (None | N): the mission hands you cameras for the launcher (quietCams / setQuietCams) — so a quiet row plays
// three ways, a press each: off · a rung · the cameras. It is a row of its own, in the rows' own classes, so a screen that steps a row's buttons (the
// start page's rail) steps it like any other; it is not one of `rows` (those are the difficulty's levers).
//
// THE FOURTH ROW AND THE SQUAD'S OWN BOTTOM RUNG (game/told.ts; the rows are game/difficulty.ts leversNow(), read once where the rows are built): while
// TOLD.on is up there is a fourth row, You're told (guided | standard | bare), a lever like the other three — a press moves it, Standard | Hard puts it
// back, it is kept with them. While TOLD.fogOff is up the fog row's OFF button is shown on a squad mission's row too, and there it is the squad lever's
// own rung (setLever('fog', 'off')): the mission is started with no fog of war, and the line beside it says that this shows more than the team can see.
//
// CONTROLS: a click on a rung (the keys stay the sheet's own: W S the missions, A D standard / hard). The DOM asked for is the little the probes' stand-in
// has: createElement, className, textContent, setAttribute, appendChild, onclick.
