// MENU STILLS — the picture on a mission's card and on a group's tile of the Play page: a moment of that mission being PLAYED.
//
// The maintainer, 10-11: "our art style is also AWESOME so if we could highlight it (maybe with prerendered level screenshots or something)"; and, 10-12, of the
// first set (composed pictures of men stood on their start): "they look somewhat staged and repetitive" · "our actual gameplay looks a lot cooler!"
//
// The pictures are FILES beside the page (public/assets/menu/<mission id>.jpg + stills.json, which lists them), taken ahead of time by tools/menu-shots: the
// mission booted from its own link, played to a moment by a scripted player on the keys and the order menu, and that frame of the real renderer drawn from a
// camera pinned for the still (its head comments say how; a mission with no recipe there keeps a picture composed by tools/menu-art.ts). Nothing here draws the
// game. A picture is one run's moment, not the visit's deal — who stands where differs — so the menu marks nothing on it (the way in is marked on the map sheet
// beside the list).
// WHERE THE FILES DID NOT COME (a mission added since the pictures were made) every call answers null and the caller draws what it drew
// before: the menu's own model of the place (ui/planArt.ts).
