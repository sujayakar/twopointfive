// THE MISSION LIST (the level select; the maintainer, 10-07: 'a nice level select screen for all our different scenarios (both quiet and loud) … think like
// mgsv did'): one screen off the start card holding EVERY run the build has — the plain solo night (the office drive mission Start has always run) and one
// row per entry of scene/scenarioList.ts SCENARIOS — laid out as a list down the left and the highlighted mission's sheet on the right: a floor plan, title,
// place, its line, the team, the defenders, whether it leans quiet or loud, 'untuned', and the Standard | Hard switch the scenario picker used to carry.
//
// A PICK IS STILL A PAGE LOAD through the query string (scene/scenarioList.ts pickSearch — main.ts boots it through game/scenarioRun.ts startFromQuery), so a
// pasted URL starts the same run; every row is a link to its own URL. The solo night's URL is `?solo`: the plain night with no start card (main.ts). The one
// shortcut: opened off the real start card over the plain night (`MISSIONS.startSolo`, ui/menu.ts), the solo night just closes the card — what Start does
// (with the loadout screen wired in between — ui/loadout.ts wireMissions — it is that screen's Deploy that takes the shortcut).
// THE SEAM for a screen between the list and the run (a loadout): `MISSIONS.onPick` / `opts.onPick` gets (mission, href) INSTEAD of the load, the list
// closed first (its keys are a capture listener: two screens up at once would fight over Enter and Esc); that screen's Back comes back with
// `openMissions({ select: mission.id })`.
//
// ITS OWN LAYER (#missions, over #menu): the boot card can open it while the shaders compile (it needs nothing of the engine), and Menu re-rendering the
// card under it does not touch it. KEYS (no held keys, nothing past 5): W S / ↑ ↓ move · A D / ← → Standard | Hard · H the next hour (Shift+H the one before) · J the next weather (Shift+J) · K the next way in (Shift+K), on a level with more than one ·
// Enter / Space start · Esc back — taken
// by ONE capture listener registered when this module loads, i.e. before main.ts's own Esc handler, so Esc here goes back instead of closing the card.
// Plain DOM, styled in index.html (#missions …). Nothing at module level uses another module's exports (ui/menu.ts imports this beside the game).
