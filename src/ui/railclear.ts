// THE TUTORIAL'S BIG LINE STAYS CLEAR OF YOUR OWN MEN (ui/overlay.ts #railprompt; the view's `lesson.rails.lineMen`, RAILS.lineClear). The line lies low in the middle
// of the screen, and with the view led up the screen (the aim on a man ahead), or in a short window, that is where the player and his partner stand: the
// plate lay over both. So the line has TWO places and no more — where it lies, and the bottom edge of the picture just under that. While a man of yours is
// under where it lies and the bottom edge is clear of them all, it is at the bottom edge (the radio's rows, which live there, go up over it: index.html
// `--raillog`); it comes home once nobody is within `hold` of where it lies, or when a man walks under the bottom edge. With both places taken it lies
// where it lies. It never follows a man and never goes up into the picture, where the step's mark and the aim are. With a ring up (ui/cmdring.ts) it is
// at home, and the ring's own step of it (`--railshift`) is the only one. Pure: boxes in, a step down out (px of the HUD layer). Picture only.
