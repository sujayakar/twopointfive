// THE TEAM AT THE DOOR, on the start page's Team & kit step (the maintainer's pick, 10-13): where the standing man was (ui/kitFigure.ts), the REAL renderer's
// top-down picture of the team as picked, stood at the mission's own way-in door. The Game behind the start page is not the picked mission's level — that
// exists only after Deploy's page load — so the picture is a SECOND instance of the page in an iframe: the same origin, the very query Deploy would load plus
// `&kitview&mute&noreplay` (src/host/kitView.ts: staged, lit, and from then on LIVE — the game runs and the open card's man uses what he carries at the door,
// a beat at a time; `&stillkit` on it = drawn for a warm window, then held; read-only on this origin's storage). It is thrown away when the page closes or
// Deploy fires, so its GPU device goes with it.
//
// WHEN: the switch on (KIT_VIEW.on; `?oldfigure` = off: the standing man everywhere, the page as it was), the Team & kit step, a room clear whose level file
// says where the team stands for the way in picked (`scenarios.kitView.ways` — ui/missions.ts kitViewWays, the plan's own fetch), and a window the figure's
// column is drawn in (over 720 px wide). Anything else is an empty column: this module then makes no element and puts no class on the page.
//
// WHAT GOES OVER: ONE iframe ELEMENT PER QUERY — when the mission's own query changes (its level, way in, hour, weather … — everything but the team's size) the
// old element is dropped and a new one made (no entry in the tab's history, and a message is from THIS element's window or it is nobody's). A kit tile or the
// team's size is a message, `{ kv: 'kit', members, squad }`, sent AT ONCE (the owner, 10-14: "after selecting something, it should start the demo animation
// immediately" — the leading edge; further changes inside KIT_VIEW.kitMs of it are folded into one more message when it has run out). The child works out
// for itself what moved: what the game can take is written on the live men, the rest is a restage under the child's own dissolve; whose card is open and
// which tile the highlight is on, `{ kv: 'sel', who, field }`, on every move of either (the child's director plays that man, and that tile's thing NOW); off the step, `{ kv: 'pause', on }`
// (the child neither steps nor draws until the step shows again); where the men should sit,
// `{ kv: 'frame', cx, cy, h, w, man }`, from the figure column's rectangle (the child frames the way's FIVE places by it, whatever the team's size). The child says `boot` (its listener is up: it is told the frame and, if the tiles
// moved since its query, the kit, the open card and the pause — again on every boot, so a child that loads itself again is told again), `ready` (the picture is fit to show), `held`,
// or `none` (nothing to stage there). The iframe is NEVER faded out once shown (the owner, 10-14: "i don't like the fade to black animations"): a child of
// an older build that still says `dip` / `undip` is heard and nothing is done. THE SWITCH for all of the acting is KIT_VIEW.acts (`?stillkit` = off: the
// child is opened `&stillkit` — the still picture, a plain restage on every change, no `sel`).
//
// NOBODY STANDS IN FOR THE PICTURE (the maintainer, 10-20: "we show the original gear screen before the new one fades in. let's just remove the old one with
// the figure?"): the standing man used to be drawn while the child booted past a short grace, and wherever there was no picture. With the switch on he is
// not on the page at all (ui/startpage.ts mounts him only under `?oldfigure`): the column WAITS EMPTY until the child's first `ready` (`data-kv-wait` on
// #missions), and is EMPTY for good (`data-kv-none`) — the element dropped, the query marked for this page's life — when the child says `none` (a refused
// device, a failed fetch, a moment that threw: every fatal card in there says it, main.ts kitViewFatal) or its load errors. THE WAIT HAS NO CLOCK: a second
// game that takes long to come up (a cold shader cache, a slow adapter) is waited for however long that is. It was given 10 s and then called none for the
// page's life — the standing man's cue while he stood in; with nobody standing in it only left the column blank for good on a slow start. The second game lives
// only while it can show: it is dropped too when the mission picked has no block, the way in is dealt (the child's die would deal another door than
// Deploy's: the query carries no seed), or the window goes under 720 px; it is kept across the Mission step. show() answers false only with the switch off
// or under 720 px (where the column is not laid out at all).
//
// LAYOUT: every rule is in the one block below; ONE root class, `kv-on`, is on #missions only while the picture is shown (the iframe's own rules stand
// without it: it must be laid out, though unseen, for its page to draw at all). The iframe is the LAST child of `.mbody`, absolutely placed behind the sheet
// and anchored left, KIT_VIEW_PLACE.wide columns wide; the figure's column is the clear window onto it — the men in its left two thirds, the door's line about six tenths across, the first metre of the room behind the door in the rest; past the
// column it fades out under the tiles by the mask alone (the card's own ground shows: a third of its strength at the first tile's left edge, gone one
// column's width on; no rule of a tile is touched) and runs on further right below them. It never takes a click or the keys. No
// words, no colours of its own.
