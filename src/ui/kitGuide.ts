// THE KIT STEP'S WALKTHROUGH — Team & kit walks the player through picking a kit by doing it, one small card at a time. This file is the ENGINE and
// the step's general script (no script is shown unasked since the one mission with a plan of its own went, 2026-11-07).
//
// The maintainer, 10-22: "we should teach how to pick squad layouts! so maybe a tutorial on the gear page for a mission (that's skippable)" — and, 10-23,
// of the walkthrough that then came up on every mission's step: "this tutorial is good but we should attach it to a tutorial mission (and make it
// bespoke and explain how to plan), not for the regular ones". So:
//   · A WALKTHROUGH IS A SCRIPT (GuideScript): its beats in the step's own order, each the row its card sits by, its words for the step as it stands,
//     and what counts as having done it. A card sits beside its row, that row lit and the rest of the step dimmed, and goes when the player has DONE
//     what it asks (or on its 'Next'). A beat whose row this mission's step does not have, or whose thing is already so, is left out.
//   · WHICH SCRIPT (guideFor): once the plan written for the mission whose step this was (none is left), played unasked on a
//     first visit. A REGULAR MISSION HAS NONE: no card, no word on the head. The step's general walkthrough (GENERIC below: the job, who comes, a kit
//     for the squad, each man, his card, go) is kept for comparing and played only when asked for on the address (`?kitguide=1`).
//   · THE PAGE UNDER A CARD IS LIVE: nothing is locked, a click anywhere does what it always did — but Enter, which on most rows of the step is Deploy,
//     is the card's 'Next' while a card is up and the highlighted row has no Enter of its own: a first press of Enter on a card must never start the
//     mission. Deploy under a card is the Deploy row's own Enter, or a click on it.
//   · SKIPPABLE AT ANY POINT: 'Skip' on every card, or Esc (the first Esc is the walkthrough's; the next is the step's own, back to the mission). The
//     keys reach it AFTER the highlighted row (ui/loadout.ts embedded.rest): an open gun pop-up's Esc shuts the pop-up, and the walkthrough stays.
//   · ONCE A BROWSER, EACH SCRIPT UNDER ITS OWN KEY: finished, skipped or deployed under, it is not shown again (localStorage, `GuideScript.ls`). THE
//     WAY BACK is the script's own word on the step's head ('How to plan'), which plays it again from its first beat whenever it is not up.
//   · NOT FOR A PAGE NOBODY SITS AT: a browser a script drives (`navigator.webdriver`: every page tool under tools/qa) is no first-time player, and the
//     tools measure the step as it stands; there it is played only when asked for (`?kitguide=1`, or the word on the head).
//   · THE SWITCH: KITGUIDE.on — on in the page, `?kitguide=0` = no walkthrough and no word on any step; `?kitguide=1` = played on this visit whatever
//     the browser remembers (a mission's plan, or the general one on a regular mission). UI only: nothing in the game reads it, and
//     it is mounted only by the one starting page (ui/startpage.ts).
// Plain DOM in the mission list's layer, one style block injected once. Nothing at module level uses another module's exports.
