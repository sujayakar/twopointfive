// THE PICKED MAN, IN 3D, ON THE TEAM & KIT STEP (the maintainer, 10-11: "can you add more visuals to the menus? like door kickers has some 2d art, ready or not
// has a 3d character view for kit menu"; 10-12: "cell shading here doesn't match the RT lighting look we're going for" · "should also have a breathing animation").
//
// The game's renderer is busy compiling behind the menus and has one view; this is a small SOFTWARE view of one man in a 2D canvas, made of the game's own
// parts so it cannot drift from what deploys: the cast's mesh in the variant, parts and palette the game will give that man (anim/gltf.ts, game/cast.ts's
// rules, render/charMaterials.ts), posed and kept alive by the game's own animator (game/character.ts: he breathes and shifts his weight as a man at rest in
// play does), with the boxes the game bolts to him for the gun his card names (game/rigProps.ts).
//
// LIT BY RAYS, LIKE THE GAME (ui/figureTrace.ts): he stands on a patch of the mission's ground under a sized lamp and a cool back light. Every point of a
// ~2 cm lattice over him and the ground (a LUMEL) keeps how much of each lamp it sees (shadow rays to points across the emitter: soft shadows that sharpen at
// a contact) and what light reaches it second hand (a gather ray a pass: the lit ground, his own lit kit, the sky — the colour of the ground comes up under
// his chin). The lattice is traced a slice a frame against the pose he was built in and keeps improving for some seconds; the light stays on his surface as
// traced (lamps and second-hand light alike, against the built pose), and a frame only re-poses him and rasters. The picture goes through the game's own tone curve, and frames are jittered and blended as the game's
// resolve does it.
//
// PICTURE ONLY. It reads the kit card it is handed and writes nothing anywhere; the game's die is not rolled (the Character it poses is its own, built and stepped under a die of this file's).
// One thing here is drawn by this file alone: the pouches on his belt for what the card carries a COUNT of (no such boxes exist in play: a can is drawn only in the fist).
// Nothing is drawn until the cast has loaded (main.ts hands it over: setFigureCast) and nowhere without a 2D canvas (the probes' DOM).
