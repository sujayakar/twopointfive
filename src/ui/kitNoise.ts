// HOW LOUD A THING ON A KIT CARD IS WHEN IT IS USED, IN THE GAME'S OWN WORDS — for the Team & kit step of a quiet mission (ui/startpage.ts: each tile that
// makes a noise wears a small sound mark of one, two or three arcs; nothing is written). No number is made up here: a step is what the floor's own sound
// event says of the thing (game.ts GameEvent `loud` / `level`, which is what a guard hears):
//   0  no event of its own (the wand, what he wears)
//   1  an event with `loud: false` — heard nearby, a look and no alarm (the suppressed pistol's report, weapons.ts; a smoke can's pop, combat.ts; a
//      sticky camera leaving the launcher and striking, stickycam.ts)
//   2  an event with `loud: true` — the floor hears it (every other gun's report; a stun can and a charge, combat.ts 'bang'; a boot or a hammer on a door)
//   3  the blast, `level: 2` — frag.ts blast(): a frag grenade, and a 40 mm grenade (he40.ts goes off with the same blast)
// A gun's step is read off its row of WEAPONS when asked, so a gun retuned there moves its mark with it.
