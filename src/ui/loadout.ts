// THE LOADOUT SCREEN (sortie prep, after a mission is picked and before the page load that starts it — the maintainer, 10-07: "a "loadout" screen or something like that
// for picking how many squad members you want … think like mgsv did!"): you and a slot per teammate, how many come — none to four — and DEPLOY, which loads the
// mission's own URL with the size on it (game/loadout.ts squadSearch: at the mission's own size it is the URL its row always loaded). The size, its rules, its
// words and its store are game/loadout.ts's; this file is the DOM and the keys. Plain DOM in an overlay of its own (#loadout, over the start card's #menu), its
// styles injected here, so nothing of the card is re-rendered under it and index.html is not touched.
//
// THE FLOW (wireMissions below, called once by main.ts): start card ▸ Missions (ui/missions.ts) ▸ a pick opens THIS screen for that mission (the list closes
// first; MISSIONS.onPick) ▸ Deploy loads the mission's URL — the list's own href, so the sheet's Standard | Hard rides along — with the size on it. Back / Esc
// reopens the list on the same row; Esc there is the start card. Also reached by URL: `?loadout=<mission id>` (main.ts, once the start card is up;
// `&squad=N` beside it preselects). THE SOLO NIGHT comes through here too (kind 'solo': the team row is greyed at solo, your own card is the only one) and
// Deploy loads `?solo`, where main.ts puts your card on the plain night's player (game/kit.ts kitSolo).
//
// WHAT IS ON IT, top to bottom: the mission · TEAM (the size) · the five member slots, each with its man's kit in a line — one of those who come is PICKED ·
// the picked member's KIT AND UNIFORM CARD (src/ui/kitCard.ts memberCard, the table is src/game/kit.ts), mounted in the one `[data-member="i"]` host under the
// slots (0 = you, 1‥4 = the teammates in staging order — game/loadout.ts rosterOf — which is KIT.members' order) · what the squad carries between them (stun
// canisters and door charges: kit.ts kitPool(size), the very number the run's staging sets) · Back and Deploy.
//
// CONTROLS (his rules: no held keys, no digit above 5): the mouse for everything (a click on a filled slot picks that man, on an empty one brings the team up
// to him, on a card's arrows and sets as the card says) · W S / ↑ ↓ move between rows: team → members → down through the picked man's card → the buttons ·
// A D / ← → change the highlighted row (the team size; which member; a card row's value; which button) · Enter / Space press (on the members row: into his
// card; in the card: the row's next value, or the picked set; elsewhere Deploy, unless Back is the highlighted button) · Esc back one screen, from anywhere.
// C copies the picked man's kit and V pastes the copied kit onto him, from any row (ui/kitCard.ts KIT_CLIP; Ctrl / Cmd with either is the same press while
// no text on the page is selected and no text field has the keys): pick a man, C, step along the roster, V on each. A man who wears the copied kit
// carries its mark on his chip. The two go by the letter on the key (kitCard.ts clipKey), the rest of the screen's keys by their place.
// While it is open every key is this screen's: the listener below is registered when this module loads — before main.ts's own — so Esc backs out of the screen
// instead of closing the start card under it; the card never listens for itself here (it is handed its keys: card.key).
//
// SEAMS: `loadoutHooks.memberCard` is the card's maker (the real one unless a probe swaps it; null = no cards, as under ?nokit); a SQUAD-WIDE ROW (one more
// thing the whole squad starts with — the silent order's 'start silent', say) appends its `.lo-row` to `screen.squadRows` (the empty box under the team row),
// splices a LoadoutRow into `screen.rows` after the squad-wide rows already there (index 1, or 2 under the Squad kit row) and calls `screen.paint()`. The screen's own first squad-wide row is the SQUAD KIT (under the
// pouches rule, kit.ts): a button for the issued kit and one for each of the cost table's named loadouts this build can carry — one press puts it on all
// five cards, colours kept (by the keys: A D move the pick along the row, Enter puts it on); the lit one is what the cards are now (none: a mix of your own).
