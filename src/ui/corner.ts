// THE CORNER PANEL IS THREE THINGS (game/handring.ts HANDRING.corner): the objective, what a quick press of his own key does, what a quick press of
// the squad's key does. Each is there only while it has something to say, and nothing else is: no heading over a row (the thing's name and state),
// no line per man of the squad, no counts of what the squad carries, no alternative under a key's line.
//
// This file is the reduction, with no page under it (ui/overlay.ts feeds it the rows it would have listed and draws what comes back;
// handring-check asks it directly). Imports the rule's own table and types.
