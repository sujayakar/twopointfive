// WHAT A GUN IS GOOD AT, DRAWN (game/kittree.ts KITTREE). The maintainer, on Team & kit (10-19): "have some way of distinguishing different guns (some
// stats?)". Four bars on a gun's tile, each a number from 0 to 1 READ OFF THE GUN'S OWN ROW of weapons.ts — nothing is typed in here, so a gun retuned there
// moves its bars with it, and a suppressor taken off (the row the card then deploys: kit.ts kitSlotDef) moves the last one:
//   reach     how far it holds a man-sized group: the range at which the row's spread (aiSpread: a teammate's hands, and the shape of yours) is half a
//             man wide — a shotgun's, the range at which its whole pattern is still on him
//   volume    the rounds it puts out in ten seconds from full, magazine changes and all (its cadence, its magazine, its reload)
//   handling  how readily it comes round in the hands (weapons.ts handlingOf: the turn weight)
//   quiet     how little of its report the floor hears (the row's report level; a suppressor's share where the round is still heard as gunfire)
// The bars are the card's own (ui/kitCard.ts: the look of the mobility and concealment bars — a notch at the issue gun's, what this gun has over it in
// green, under it in amber); what a gun weighs is already those two bars.
