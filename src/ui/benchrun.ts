// THE BENCHMARK ACROSS PAGE LOADS — a level is only ever loaded at boot, so a run over the benchmark's scenes (host/benchScenes.ts) is one page per scene. What
// ties the pages into one run is this file: the address each scene is played on, and a small record in the tab's own session store (it dies with the tab, and
// nothing of it leaves the machine) that carries the lines measured so far from one page to the next. ui/bench.ts plays one page's part (a BenchLeg) and knows
// nothing of addresses or stores.
//   HOW A RUN GOES: the row (or ?bench on any address) → begin(): the record is written and the first scene's address loads. Each scene's page finds the record
//   at boot (legOfPage), plays its part and hands on (the record grows, the next address loads); the last page shows the card, and closing it loads the address
//   the run was started from.
//   THE SCENES ARE THE SET'S, NOT THE VISITOR'S: of the flags on the address the run was asked on, only the ones that change no fight ride along (CARRIED); a
//   scene's address says its own level, deal, die and difficulty, keeps no verdict of the try and files no replay of it (the fight was not the visitor's).
//   BACK DOES NOT START ANOTHER: a run asked for on the address REPLACES that address with the first scene's, and each scene's with the next.
//   A RELOAD IN THE MIDDLE DOES NOT START IT AGAIN: a page marks the record as begun on its scene before it plays, and a page that finds its own mark drops the
//   record and is a plain mission page.
