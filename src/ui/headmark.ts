// The mark over a man's head on the HUD (overlay.ts draws it): which glyph and which colour class, and nothing about where. Kept apart from the DOM so that a

//
// WHOSE MARKS: the '?', the row of dots and the '◎' are the stealth game's read of a man who may find you out — how wary he is, how much has reached him,
// whether he has you lined up. Over one of your own men they say nothing you can act on (his number is not a guard's: under an order nothing drains it, so a
// can or a blast left dots standing over him for the rest of the mission), so a living teammate carries none of them. What state he is in is read off the man.
