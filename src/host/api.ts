// HostApi — what the GAME needs from "the engine", named once (the member list is what a Proxy logged of the game's calls
// plus what grep finds in src/game). Two implementations: the WebGPU `Engine` (src/engine.ts — conforms structurally, asserted once in src/main.ts), the headless
// stand-in (src/host/stub.ts: fake device, null smoke, a probe that never answers — tools/qa/headless.ts's shape). (A third, a native Metal host, was removed
// 2026-10; it is in git history.)
//
// `Game(engine: HostApi, …)` (game.ts) and guards.ts take this type by `import type`, so the game layer no longer pulls src/engine.ts — and with it every render pass module
// and every WGSL text — into a bundle that only wants the simulation. Nothing here has a value at run time: types only.
//
// REQUIRED members are the ones game code reads unguarded; OPTIONAL ones are what it already reads defensively (`engine.setParticles?.()`, `(engine as { weather? }).weather`,
// `engine.viewFocus ?? …`) — the QA harness's stand-in has only the required set and every frozen digest was recorded against exactly that, so the stub keeps to it.
// A FULL host (the WebGPU Engine, the native host) implements every member.
