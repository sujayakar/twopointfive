// stepFrame — THE ONE FRAME ORDER, shared by src/main.ts (the browser) and the native entry: what happens between "a frame's dt is known" and
// "the host has drawn it", in the order main.ts's step() always ran it. Everything the browser loop reads off the DOM (canvas size, document.hidden, the menu, the tweak panel,
// the veil / body classes, perfrec's timings) is a field or a closure on LoopCtx; nothing here touches window / document, and the Game is imported as a TYPE only (src/game/'s
// 22-file import cycle: no top-level use of a game import in a host module — this file has none).
//
//   time += dt · frozen → dt 0 + input.endFrame() · afterFreeze (main: the attract still refresh) · cam.zoom / rotate off Ctrl-wheel / Ctrl-drag · hotkeys (main: debug view,
//   exposure, Tab, F9 / F10, P, arrows; on a frozen frame they are shown the keys pressed on it, and only they are) · [view has a size:] demo.update BEFORE game.update (the tour presses THIS frame's keys) · attract.update · game.update(dt, input, cam,
//   view) · the director's frame + postUpdate (main: the show class, the debrief card) · nvAmount / hitFlash → settings · audio listener + update · smoke.update · spectate
//   auto-yaw / ease-yaw + the pitch ease · cam.update(dt, look-at, aim lead) · caption + timeline · lights.update(dt, t) · render(cam, t, dt, present) · hud.update ·
//   bubbles.update (+ hudExpireBubbles inside it) · input.endFrame()
//
// THE FIXED STEP (FIXEDSTEP below; engine groundwork for two-player co-op, nothing networked): with the switch on and the host saying this frame is a live one (LoopCtx.fixedStep —
// main.ts: not a scripted __runFrames frame), the game is stepped in whole ticks of exactly 1 / hz whatever the display's rate: the frame's time goes into an accumulator
// (planTicks), every tick is demo.update → attract.update → game.update → lights.update → the camera's step with the SAME dt, and a frame draws whatever the last tick left. So the simulation computes
// the same numbers on a 60, a 120 and a 144 Hz display (tools/qa/fixedstep-check.ts), which a variable step never can. One-frame input edges (a key press, a click, the wheel)
// belong to exactly ONE tick: the first of the frame; a frame with no tick hands them to the next frame's first tick (the hotkeys have had their look and do not see them twice).
// THE CAMERA STEPS WITH THE TICK (camStep below: the spectate yaw, the pitch ease, FollowCamera.step — after the tick's update, on the tick's dt): the next tick's input
// record takes its view from it (game/cmd.ts sampleCmd: the walk keys' basis, the aim ray, the order menu's picks), so a camera eased by the display's frame time would
// make two displays two games (tools/qa/tween-check.ts 'same hands'). A hand's turn of the camera (Ctrl + drag: Input.orbitDX) is given in the frame's first tick for
// the same reason, owed to the next frame's by a frame that runs none; and the engine's view focus (what the wind is gathered round) is set after every tick, not once a
// render. What stays per drawn frame on the display's own dt: the mixer, the smoke solver, the render, a
// blast's kick. BETWEEN TICKS (host/tween.ts TWEEN, its own switch; LoopCtx.tween): a
// frame that falls between two ticks is drawn between them — what moves (keyed boxes, the men, carried lights, the camera itself) at the blend of the tick
// before the last and the last, a constant part of a tick behind the game (none on a display at the tick rate, never more than one: tween.ts phase), and never read back
// by it: the blend hangs on the drawn objects from just before the host's render to just after. With that
// switch off there is no interpolation: off 60 Hz the men and the camera move at 60 a second on a display that draws more, and on a frame of two ticks or more (a display
// under the tick rate, a hitch) a flash that lives one tick and was made in the frame's first is aged out by its second and never drawn (with it on, tween.ts draws it once).
// The module's default is off = every statement below as it was; THE PAGE turns both on (host/profile.ts pageSwitches: ?fixedstep=0, ?tween=0).
