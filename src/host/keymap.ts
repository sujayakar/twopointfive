// THE PLAYER'S OWN KEYS: which key on the board gives each key the game asks for. Options ▸ Controls rebinds one (ui/keybinds.ts), this machine keeps it
// (localStorage `twopointsix.keys`), and Reset there puts every one back. `?keybinds=0` = the build's own keys for the visit, the kept ones left as kept.
// OFF IN THE MODULE: the game page turns it on as it boots (`keysBoot`, main.ts's first line). A headless tool, the level editor, the viewer and the workbench
// never do, so their keys are the build's whatever this machine has kept.
// WHERE IT SITS: at the keyboard, and nowhere else. game/input.ts asks `gameCode()` what a key that went down IS before it files it, so the game goes on asking
// for the codes it always did (`input.hit('KeyR')`), and everything downstream of the Input is as it was: the tick's PlayerCmd, the session journal, a run's
// tape, a replay. A recording made with R on another key holds 'KeyR' and plays the same on any machine. Nothing here is read by src/game but that one call
// (and the keyboard's own two: `camKey` and `KEYMAP.pinchOnly`, which key the camera is on and what the wheel under Ctrl is):
// it is no rule of the game, so it is no knob table and the harness's two stands (whose Input has no keyboard) never meet it.
// WHAT CAN MOVE: the keys of KEY_ACTS, one row each. A key that does two things in the build (E puts away and swaps a hold; V whistles and is a row of the order
// menu; the digits are the kit and the menu's rows) moves as one: it is the KEY that is rebound, not the verb. The mouse, the wheel and the camera's key stay (Ctrl, or the Space bar
// while no row has it: `camSpace`, `camKey` — it is no row, so it has no cap to click and a row put on Space takes Space from it).
// WHAT CANNOT BE TAKEN: the page's own keys (FIXED below). Everything else on the board can.
// NO TWO ROWS ON ONE KEY: a key given to a row that another row has is a SWAP (the other takes the key this one had; with none to give it is left with no key,
// and says so). A key whose row moved away does nothing.
// THE NAMES FOLLOW: `keyLabel` is the cap, `keyCap` turns a cap the HUD was handed ('F', 'Space', '2') into the one bound now, `keyText` does the same for the
// keys named in a line of words. With nothing rebound all three hand back what they were given, untouched.
// `keyText` READS FINISHED WORDS, and that is a guess: a cap standing alone is taken for the key unless the words round it say it is a place's letter ('room B',
// 'Vault B', 'B wing', 'T-junction'); a digit only where the words say key ('then 3', '2 again'); the walk keys only in a list of keys. A line that hands the
// HUD a code instead of a letter would need none of it: the lines are written all over the game, and that is a pass of its own.
// A ROW THE BUILD GIVES NO KEY (`KEYMAP.qFree`, `FREED`): the wall hold's. Walking into a wall takes it and walking off it lets go (game/wallsnap.ts `press`),
// so its key is spare and Q is left for something else. The game goes on asking for 'KeyQ' and MEANS the wall hold by it, as every recording made before
// does; what changed is the board: nothing on it gives that code until the player puts the row on a key here (Q itself, if he likes: a rebind like any
// other, kept, and Reset takes it off again). Q pressed with the row unbound files nothing. OFF IN THE MODULE like the rest; the game page turns it on as
// it boots, `?qfree=0` = Q takes the wall as it did. It does not wait on `on`: `?keybinds=0` is the build's own board, and the build's own board has no wall key.
// ONLY WHILE WALKING IN WORKS (`KEYMAP.freeWhen`, the page's: the walk-in switch as it stands this frame): with that switched off (Options ▸ Game,
// `?wallpress=0`) the row is on Q again, there and then, so there is never a board with no way onto a wall but the one the player made himself.
// KEPT AS HE SET IT: a freed row's entry in the kept table is never folded into 'as built' (what is built moves with the two switches): the wall put on Q by
// hand stays on Q through a visit under `?qfree=0` or a spell with the walk-in off.
// THE LETTER IS NOT THE ROW'S while it is freed and unbound: no line of words is rewritten for it ('Q' in a line is then some other thing's, or nobody's);
// the two lists that show the row write its words themselves (ui/options.ts wallWay). A second thing wanting Q asks the game for a code of its own and
// is given Q here, and takes the cap 'Q' with it: the wall hold's row wants another name for its cap that day.
// THE SQUAD'S COMMAND KEY IS Q (`KEYMAP.qCmd`, `MOVED`): that second thing. It needed no code of its own: the quick order's row (code 'KeyB', which the
// game goes on asking for and every recording holds) has Q for its key in the build, and the B key gives nothing. So a tap of Q IS the press B was, by the
// one read the game has for it, and the row keeps its id: a table kept before, with the command put on some other key, means what it meant. The row's
// cap in the build's words stays 'B' (a line that says 'B on the door' is rewritten to the key it is on: 'Q' untouched, the player's own if he moved it),
// so no two rows share a cap and the wall hold's is still 'Q'. ONLY WITH `qFree`: under `?qfree=0` Q is the wall's and the command is on B, as it was.
// And while it has Q the wall hold never falls back to Q: with walking in switched off the hold has no key until the player gives it one. Kept as he
// set it, like a freed row: the command put back on B by hand stays on B. `?bkey` = the command on B for the visit (Q then as the lines above say).
// Q ALREADY HIS: a table kept with another row on Q (Reload put there while Q was spare, the wall hold given Q back by hand) leaves the command on B,
// its own code's key, as it was before the move; it is on no key only when both are held. Nothing is kept for that: the row he put on Q moved away,
// the command is on Q again.
// THE SQUAD'S ONLY KEYS (`KEYMAP.qOnly`, `DROPPED`; the maintainer, 10-22: "squad is now just q and f. everything is through the radial menu … so we don't
// need all the other keys"): the orders menu's row (code 'KeyX') and the who row (code 'KeyT') have no key in the build, the way the wall hold's has
// none. The game goes on asking for both codes and every recording holds them; nothing on the board gives them. A row kept on a key from before keeps
// it, as he set it, and Options lists such a row only while it has one (ui/options.ts squadRows): on a fresh machine neither can be given a key there.
// X and T pressed with the rows unbound file nothing, and no line of words is rewritten for them. The page turns it on as it
// boots with the ring that carries every order (game/cmdring.ts `only`); `?qonly=0`, or `?qring=0` (no ring: the menu needs its key), = both on their keys.
// THE MENU'S LETTERS GO WITH ITS KEY (`KEYMAP.letGo`, `LETTERS`; only with `qOnly`): frag and clear on G, the big tool and the squad's smoke on H are
// rows of that menu and do nothing without it (a wheel up takes them from nobody: game/orders.ts). While the ring carries every order and the menu's
// row has no key those two ARE ASLEEP: no key, nothing to bind, and G and H on the board are spare — a row put on one takes it from nobody, where it
// used to swap with a row no list shows and leave that row sitting unseen on the key it gave up. Options lists them by the same facts (ui/options.ts
// squadRows). The menu on a key (kept from before): both are rows again, on G and H or where he put them, rebound like any other. KEPT AS HE SET IT:
// what is kept for a sleeping letter stays kept and means the same when it wakes, on this board or a visit on another — but a key given to another row
// while it slept is that row's (the letter's entry goes with the key), and a letter never takes the menu's own key. The facts are LIVE, the way the
// wall hold's are: `onlyWhen` (the page hands it game/cmdring.ts `only`: the debugger can put the old menu back mid-visit, and the letters wake with
// it) and `throwWhen` (game/quickthrow.ts: G is the quick throw's key then, with no menu up, and stays awake — NO LIST SHOWS IT there, which is the
// old flaw on that one key for that visit). OFF IN THE MODULE; the page turns it on as it boots, `?menuletters=0` = both rows on G and H as they were.
// TWO MORE ROWS THE BUILD GIVES NO KEY (`KEYMAP.setFree`, `SETFREED`): the selector's (Z) and the weapon light's (L). Both are rows of the setup that the
// digit of the gun in his hands opens (game/slotsetup.ts), so neither needs a key of its own. As with the wall hold: the game goes on asking for 'KeyZ'
// and 'KeyL', the board gives neither until the player puts the row on a key here, a kept entry is kept as he set it, and the letters are not the rows'
// while they are unbound. The page turns it on as it boots; `?slotsetup=0` (the setup's own word) = Z and L as they were.
// EMPTY HANDS ARE A SLOT ON BACKTICK (`KEYMAP.slotWhen`, `SLOT`; the rule is game/handslot.ts): while the page says the slot is on, its code ('Digit0') has
// the backtick key in the build, the debugger's code ('Backquote', which the page goes on asking for) has the backslash key, and E's row (put away or
// draw, the swap of a hold) has no key: E is spare. Nothing kept is rewritten; a row he moved stays where he put it. IN WORDS the letter E is still the
// way a line names putting it away ('E puts it away', written all over the game and its lessons): while the slot is on that letter is read as the
// slot's key (`ALIAS`), so those lines follow without being rewritten, and follow a rebind of the slot. OFF IN THE MODULE (`slotWhen` null).
// HIS OWN ACTIONS ARE A RING (`KEYMAP.handWhen`, `HAND`, `HAND_SLOT`; the rule is game/handring.ts): while the page says so the whistle's row has no key
// (it is the ring's last wedge; its letter in a line of words is left alone, as a freed row's is), and over the slot's layer the interaction's row is on
// E, the Space key giving the game nothing: 'Space  open' reads 'E  open'. OFF IN THE MODULE (`handWhen` null).
// (E's letter is the slot's) Only while E's row has no key: put on a key by hand it is that key again, in caps and in words, and its row is back on the Controls list. The slot's
// row with the slot OFF is no row: it is on no list and holds no key against another row. Backtick already given to another row by hand: the slot is
// on the 0 key, its own code's; backslash given away: the debugger has no key until he gives it one.
// Imports nothing.
