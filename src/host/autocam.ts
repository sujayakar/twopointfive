// THE CAMERA RUNS ITSELF (AUTOCAM). Asked for by the maintainer, 2026-10-23: a double tap of the camera's key turns an auto camera on, that key with movement
// gives the view back to the hand, and the camera should read what the player means the way one tap of the squad's key does.
// The follow camera frames one thing: Sam, leaned toward the cursor. This module works out a frame from what the game already knows and the camera never
// used — the door under his hand and the floor past it, the squad's orders and the beat each door order is on, the enemies IN THE PICTURE, the space he
// stands in — and the loop (loop.ts camStep) gives the follow camera that frame in place of his feet while the mode is on (findme.ts AUTOVIEW:
// the camera's key tapped twice puts it on; the hand on the camera — the key held with the mouse moved, or with a walk key — puts it off).
//   WHAT IT FRAMES, the higher taking over from the lower as it comes up (frame()):
//     a fight    an enemy he could shoot (in the picture and in his line): the look-at goes part of the way to them, and nothing lower is asked
//     the squad  an order just given, and each beat of a door order (set, the word, the entry): the door, then the floor past it, for `beatSecs`
//     the door   the one under his hand (Game.useDoor), or the way out he is walking at: the floor past it
//     the room   a little of the way to the middle of the room he stands in, so the frame moves less than he does
//   …always inside a box round him in the camera's own basis (`sideM`, `awayM`, `backM` at the usual distance: he never leaves the middle of the screen),
//   eased (`lean`), still while a button is down (a burst under way aims through a frame that only follows him), and NEVER BY THE CURSOR: the aim lean is
//   off while the mode is on. THE ZOOM is the hand's own (`AutoCam.base`: where it stood when the mode came on, and the wheel under the camera's key moves
//   it), a little tighter in a room and in close, wider under the sky and under fire, and out as far as `fitMost` to hold what it frames; it never comes in
//   on a fight. THE TURN (turnGoal) only with his feet still and nothing hostile in the picture, nothing in his hands' way, and for two reasons alone: a
//   wall between the lens and him, or the thing it frames lying on the lens's side of him, where the picture is shortest. The walk keys and the aim are
//   read through the view (cmd.ts), so a turn under a held key would walk him somewhere else: a walk key or a button ends a turn where it is, and his
//   aim is carried round with it (host/findme.ts AimCarry, as the double tap's is).
//   THE SWAY (`sway`, autoSway): the turn above is a turn at rest. With `sway` on the view may also turn while he fights and while he moves, by another
//   rule that keeps the hand's own yaw as its anchor: the yaw leans, slowly and by a spring (no step, no jump), toward the men he could shoot — so the
//   fight comes up the screen, where the picture is longest — and toward the side he is moving to, never more than `swayMax` from where the hand left the
//   view, never to a yaw that would put a wall between the lens and him or a man he could shoot, and still while a button is down. It is a function of the
//   moment, not a sum of turns: the fight over or his feet still, it comes back to the hand's yaw. Nothing carries his aim through it: the view turns
//   slowly under a live cursor, as the floor does when he walks. Off = the view turns by itself only at rest.
//   WHAT IT MAY KNOW: what the picture shows. An enemy the fog hides is never asked about (FogOfWar.hidden), and no sound is: Game.events is every sound
//   on the floor, the HUD marks none of them, and a lean toward one would point at a man the fog hides.
//   IT WRITES NOTHING OF THE GAME'S: read() asks (roomRead, the fog, the orders, the door tools) and the frame goes to the host's camera. The view is the
//   seat's input (cmd.ts), so a recording replays the view it was made with whatever this table says; with the mode never put on the build is the build
//   as it was. It stands down wherever the view is not Sam's own: the sky seat, a spectated man, a show, a pin — the loop asks.
//   THE HAND'S OWN TUNING (`tune`, the foot of this file). The maintainer, of his first play of the mode: "I was getting a little bit motion sick ... I
//   think it's from like having too much rotation", and asked for "a ton of different options of like modes or like sliders to configure in the settings
//   panel". With `tune` on the numbers that decide how much the view turns, leans and zooms are the player's: a MODE (never · only at rest · gentle ·
//   free; `gentle` is the start, `free` is every number as it was) and rows over it, kept per machine and shown on Options (ui/findme.ts). These
//   exist for it and do nothing at their module values: a turn of the mode's own may be EASED (`turnCap`: a spring with a top speed and a ramp up to
//   it, where the turn as built took a share of what was left each second and so began at its fastest) and so may the double tap's swing
//   (`swingCap`); a turn at rest has a row for each of its two reasons (`rest`, the wall that hides him; `restAhead`, the thing framed on the lens's
//   side); and the frame's lean and the zoom's travel each have a share of their own (`leanK`, `zoomAmt`). An eased turn is seconds long, so the
//   loop treats it as it treats the sway and not as the quick turn: no aim carried, the mouse does not end it, `gap` from where it is seen to stop
//   (host/loop.ts). Off = the numbers as they were, to the bit.
//   THE SOFT LOCK (`lock`, read() and frame()). The maintainer, of a review of Chaos Theory's "closer than ever": "there's definitely stuff for the auto
//   camera mode to learn". What that review says of the camera on an approach (a machine's rough transcript of it): whenever an enemy is on screen the
//   camera shifts its focus to him, and as the player moves closer its focus becomes stronger and stronger, almost as if he were soft locked on — so
//   subtly that most players never notice. Here: the man he is stalking (game/stalk.ts), or else the nearest hostile man the picture shows in his
//   line who is NOT onto him (the one it has stays until another is `lockStick` nearer, and through `lockLinger` behind a pillar), is the man of the
//   lock from `lockM` in; its strength rises to full at `lockNearM`, eased (`lockEase`). Nobody is while it is a FIGHT (somebody the picture shows is
//   onto him, or was within `lockCalm`), and but for a stalk nobody is while he is not sneaking (the rifle up, a sprint, a body in tow, a kick, a
//   lock, the wand, a throw being aimed). The frame goes from the middle of the men he could shoot to the middle of the two of them, and the camera
//   goes toward the lock's own distance — the place's zoom less `lockIn` of it, never so near that a man he could shoot leaves the picture (a door
//   ahead and the squad's beat do not hold the lock out). A man held keeps it in close (the frame as it was). The zoom as it was is worked out
//   untouched under it (`A.goal`: the place's own zoom, the band); `lockIn` goes by the hand's share of the zoom (`zoomAmt`), and at none of either
//   the distance is as it was to the bit. One rule of the zoom gives way to it, by its strength: "it never comes in on a fight" holds the zoom out
//   while any man is in his line, and the lock's man lets it back in as the lock takes hold. A held button stills it as it stills the frame — the
//   strength and the share it takes, though never so that the men he could shoot leave the picture — but for the held click of a stalk or of the
//   wait at a corner (it aims at nothing), a man in his arm, and letting go once a fight has begun. The view gone to somebody else (plan mode, a
//   show): the lock lets go at once and the distance is the zoom's own. No turn is added: it moves and zooms the frame.
// Off here (the frozen stand); the page raises `on`, `sway`, `tune` and `lock` (host/profile.ts: `?autocam=0` off, `?autoturn=0`, `?autozoom=0`,
// `?autosway=0`, `?autotune=0` and `?autolock=0` for those alone).
// tools/qa/autocam-check.ts holds it (AUTOCAM_BREAK=1 = the switch left off, AUTOSWAY_BREAK=1 = the sway left off, AUTOTUNE_BREAK=1 = the tuning left
// off, AUTOLOCK_BREAK=1 = the soft lock left off: their lines must fail).
