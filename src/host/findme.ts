// FINDING YOUR OWN MAN ON THE SCREEN, and how the camera answers the hand: fourteen settings to play with on twelve rows (Options > Game; ui/findme.ts draws the ring, hands
// the renderer the outline's frame and builds the rows). With all of them as they start the game is as it stood before it had them, on the page and on both
// of the harness's stands: the ring and the outline start off and the camera's three start as the camera was. (THE PAGE, since 2026-10-26, starts the
// outline ON at the maintainer's own numbers, the aim pan at none and the turn the other way — FINDME_TUNED and findMeStarts, below; the module and the
// frozen stand are as this says.) The seven rows under `outline` are read only
// while it is on, and three of those are NOT how the outline was first built: `picture`, `mates` and `colour` (the rims by the picture, teammates rimmed,
// the rims in colour) are on from their
// starts for a machine that keeps the outline on. (One more is SHELVED, 2026-10-20: his shape
// through a wall. A kept line that still names it reads as if it did not: ui/findme.ts says why.)
//   pan      how far the view leans from the man toward the aim point, as a share of the follow camera's own lead (FollowCamera.aimLead as it was built):
//            1 = as it was · 0 = he is the middle of the screen wherever the mouse goes
//   ring     the gold ring at his feet (the one an open order menu draws: ui/planfloor.ts) on at all times
//   outline  a rim round him while the light meter says he is in the dark — his true silhouette, drawn by the renderer from the pixels that are his
//            (render/outline.ts). A kept line from the days it was a figure drawn over the picture (before 2026-10-20) turns this one on
//   width    how wide that rim is, as a share of the rim's own width (render/outline.ts OUTLINE, outlineRadius): 1 = that width · 0 = no rim at all.
//            Nothing reads it while `outline` is off
//   opacity  how strongly that rim is drawn where it is at its full: its ink's opacity, 0 = none … 1 = solid
//   lit      the light (Player.visibility, 0 dark … 1 lit) at and over which there is no rim
//   dark     the light at and under which the rim is at its full; between the two it fades by the light (outlineWant). Neither row crosses the other
//            (put: `lit` stops at `dark`, `dark` at `lit`), so the number a row shows is the number in force. The maintainer, with the rim on
//            his GPU: "it should probably fade in and out smoothly based on how lit up sam is -- sliders to calibrate that". These three start at the
//            numbers the rim was built with; what he settles on is to become their starts
//   picture  what the rim fades by. true = THE PICTURE, part by part: the rim beside each part of him is as strong as that part is dark AS DRAWN
//            (render/outline.ts reads the composite), so a lit shoulder has
//            none and the leg in shadow has one, and nothing swings with the meter's one number. false = the light meter's word for the whole man,
//            as the rim was first built. The maintainer, of that: "the current pulsing of the outline really ruins the lighting", and "is there
//            a way to make it so it naturally turns on for dark parts of the character and off for bright parts? that might make it feel less pulsey"
//   picLit, picDark   the same two ends for the picture: brightness ON THE SCREEN (0 black … 1 white) of a part of him at and over which it has no
//            rim, and at and under which the whole rim. Their own numbers, not `lit` and `dark` read in another unit: the two light rows show and
//            move the pair of whichever `picture` says, so a hand's tuning of one is not the other's. They start where the meter's do, a guess
//   mates    his teammates rimmed too, each by his own light: what their rim covers as a share of what his does on the same picture (render/outline.ts
//            outlineRadius `times`), 0 = no rim round them … 2 = twice his
//   colour   how much colour the rims have: 0 = the pale ink they were first drawn in … 1 = yellow for him, red and blue for the two pairs
//            (OUTLINE_INK). The maintainer: "can you also add outlines for teammates + have a separate slider for thickness multiplier relative
//            to the player? make the outline for the player yellow and for teammates red/blue and have a slider for saturation"
//   turn     which way the view turns under Ctrl + the mouse: 1 = as it was · -1 = the other way
//   behind   Ctrl tapped twice brings the view round to look where he was looking at the tap. NOT 'the camera behind him' in a third-person game's sense, and
//            it cannot be while the system cursor is the aim: he faces the cursor's point in the world, the cursor stays where it is on the screen, so as
//            the view turns he would turn with it. So his aim is CARRIED round with the view (AimCarry, below): he goes on facing what he faced, now at
//            the top of the screen, until the hand uses the mouse or a key that reads the cursor; then the cursor is the aim again
// pan, turn and behind change the seat's VIEW, and the view is the player's input (game/cmd.ts carries it as data, tick by tick): a recording replays the view
// it was made with whatever these say today, and no rule of the game reads this table. ring is the HUD's alone and outline the picture's: nobody's senses,
// no light meter and no digest can tell either on from off.
// KEPT PER MACHINE (localStorage `twopointsix.findme`), read as this module loads and again when the page says which starts are in force (findMeStarts);
// a harness has no store and gets the starts. Only the rows that
// are NOT at their starts are written (keep), so a start that is tuned later reaches every machine whose row stands at the old start — a row put back to
// its start by hand is one of those: these are rows on trial, and their starts are what the maintainer's own hand is settling. A line an older build kept
// whole is written again that way as the page reads it under its own starts. No imports, on purpose:
