// THE KIT VIEW (`?kitview`): this page as a PICTURE of the team as picked, stood at the mission's own way-in door — the start page's Team & kit step shows it
// in an iframe where the standing man was (src/ui/kitView.ts; the maintainer's pick, 10-13). The Game behind the start page is not the picked mission's level,
// and a mission's level and team exist only after Deploy's page load; so the picture is drawn by a SECOND instance of the page, opened on the very query
// Deploy would load plus `&kitview&mute&noreplay`, and thrown away. Nothing staged here can reach a run.
//
// IN THIS MODE: no title, start page, pause card, HUD or cursor (index.html body.kitview hides all but the canvas), no sound, no key or mouse, and NOT ONE
// WRITE to the origin's storage, which this instance shares with the real page (the guard below: this window's Storage writes do nothing, it has no IndexedDB and asks for no
// persistence). After the scenario
// from the URL has staged its team (main.ts scenarioFromUrl): the fog of war off, everybody who is not the team parked far off and dark (as `__stage` parks),
// the team put on slots by the door, turned and held, the lamps hung, ONE zero-length game step to pose them (as main.ts refreshFrozenStill does), the camera
// pinned — and from then on, by the mode:
//   THE LOOP (the page's own; the owner after seeing the held picture on a GPU, 10-14: "it stutters … really it should be looping some animation showing off
//   the currently selected gear"): the world RUNS — stepped and drawn at an even pace (kitViewPacer below), the rain falling, the bodies idling — and a
//   small director plays BEATS in it (below), for as long as the parent says the step is showing (`pause`: nothing stepped or drawn until it shows again).
//   STILL (`&stillkit` on the query — the parent's KIT_VIEW.acts off): the world frozen (`loop.frozen`), the picture drawn for a warm window
//   (KIT_VIEW_STAGE.warm frames: the denoisers' histories) and then HELD: the frame loop stops stepping and drawing until asked again (a restage, a resize,
//   a frame message). No beat, no dissolve: every kit message a plain restage.
//
// WHERE: level data, `scenarios.kitView.ways[way]` (scene/scenarios.ts KitViewWay; `way` = RoomClearScenario.way — 0 the level's own start, k its starts[k − 1]).
// Only the door is needed: stack slots along the wall on the team's side, KIT_VIEW_STAGE.off m off the wall line and KIT_VIEW_STAGE.gap m apart from KIT_VIEW_STAGE.jamb m past
// the jamb away from the hinge — the men as staged, side on to the wall and facing the door; Sam across the door, further off the
// wall and turned onto it; a fourth teammate behind him. A slot that is not free floor (the nav grid) is stepped over. The camera looks into the wall, turned
// KIT_VIEW_STAGE.yaw toward the stack, at the game's own pitch, from a distance that grows with the stack. Authored `slots` / `pin` / `light` lie over all of that.
//
// THE PARENT TALKS BY postMessage (same origin, and only the window that holds this frame): `{ kv: 'kit', members, squad }` = the cards into the kit table
// through the store's own reader (main.ts hands kitLoad over a store that is the message: nothing saved) and the squad's size on the knob — then, STILL: the
// encounter restarted (the scenario's own staging and kitStage run again) and all of the above again; THE LOOP: this page works out what moved and writes
// it LIVE where the game can take it (the kit handler below), and what it cannot is a restage under the DISSOLVE · `{ kv: 'sel', who, field }` = whose card
// is open (0 = Sam) and the tile under its highlight: the director's man, and the thing he uses — NOW · `{ kv: 'pause', on }` = the step is not showing ·
// `{ kv: 'frame', cx, cy, h, w? }` = where the men should sit in the
// view (NDC centre, y up; h = their share of its height, w = the most of its width they may take, man = a standing man's height at most): the camera has no lens shift, so the look point slides along the camera's right and the ground's
// forward and the distance is scaled. With `door, left, right, keep` on it (NDC x) the picture is hung on the DOOR instead of the men's middle: the door's
// line (its middle, a metre up) at `door`, the five places' reach no further left than `left` nor right than `right` — the men made smaller for it, but no
// smaller than `keep` of the size the fit on their middle gives them: past that the places are held at `left` and the door sits right of `door` (the room behind
// the door is then part of the clear picture: a can thrown through it is seen). This page says `{ kv: 'ready' }` once the first picture has KIT_VIEW_STAGE.ready frames in it, `{ kv: 'held' }` whenever a
// still picture has settled, `{ kv: 'boot' }` once at start (its listener is up: the parent answers with the frame, the kit, the open card), `{ kv: 'none' }` when there is nothing to
// stage (the room clear did not start, no block or door for this way, a team the game did not make the size a kit message asked, a throw while staging or in the restart before it) —
// and when this page put up its fatal card (main.ts fatalOnce): the parent drops the frame whenever it hears it,
// shown or not. It never says `dip` (the fade to black is gone, the owner 10-14: the dissolve is this page's own, under the parent's eye). `window.__kitview` = the state, for checks.
//
// THE LOOP'S BEATS (the owner's pick, 10-13: "the door, and it acts"; 10-14: looping, and what is carried; 10-14 again, after playing it: "after selecting
// something, it should start the demo animation immediately … too many beats before something happens", "kind of jerky", "i don't like the fade to black
// animations. switching between squad members should have them swap places in the stack"). ONE man acts: the man whose card is open (`who`). He LIVES on
// the head slot by the jamb (a teammate's card opened: the same men walk — `rotate`), so a throw is a half step. A PICK — the highlight on another tile, a
// value changed on the open card, another card — CUTS whatever is running (`cut`) and that tile's thing begins the same frame, from the pose and place he
// is in: no rest in front of it, never by way of his slot. The loop then HOLDS on the highlighted tile (BEATS: its row's own rest between repeats); no
// tile with a row under the highlight: the gun, then the light. A tile's thing plays at a count of 0 too. QUIET rows — the gun (up onto the door, a scan,
// down: no round fired), the weapon light (on at his feet, the leaf pushed, the beam slices the opening, off), suit and trim (an eased quarter turn and
// back), a gun changed (the holster move, then the gun's row); a can THROUGH the door — smoke, Sam's stun (a half step and his hand on the leaf together,
// the can to a spot just inside, the leaf pulled to behind it); LOUD ones by the squad's own door orders, cut before anybody goes in — a stun canister, a
// frag, a door charge (set, stood off, blown). THE REST OF THE KIT (10-15, the owner's first note: "we should have animations for all the pieces of gear") — Sam's
// OPTICAL WAND (on his knee at the shut door, the lens fed under it and turned: the game's own row, the fog of war the game's for its length and lifted for
// every draw), a STICKY CAMERA (the leaf held, one shot of the launcher onto the nearest wall inside), the 40 MM (shouldered down the wall away from the
// stack and NOT fired: through this door it is a dud), the WALL CHARGE (the squad's own order to the whole team: set on the stack's wall, walked off, blown,
// the hole held, then a restage that stands the wall and the men again); and IDLE LIFE: the men a row is not about let their guns wander a few degrees
// (the hammer and the breaching shotgun of the big slot open the picture's shut door from beside the frame — the tool in his hands for the blow). SAM'S OWN door charge (the game's own row at the door, by his own key — the stack steps a slot back while his
// hands are on it, he steps off the door's line and blows it) and his own FRAG (through the door, the leaf pulled to a hand ajar behind it, everybody
// down on a knee through the fuse; the teammates cannot be hurt in this page: Guard.god). What a row leaves that has no undo (a blown door, a frag's marks) is HELD as a resting picture and mended
// under the dissolve when the next row starts or KIT_VIEW_LOOP.hold ends. Every action is the GAME's: the squad's orders to a teammate, `Game.puppet` and
// Sam's own keys for Sam (set for the length of his beat alone: while it is set the orders clear themselves). NO POSE SNAPS: every man's body and aim yaw
// comes round under a rate (THE YAWS below). The men a beat is not about stand as staged; the defenders are parked and calmed again every frame (the AI is on: the
// room fight is live, so the goggles are drawn, the teammates' pace is capped and a stun spares its own side); a transient light is no brighter than
// KIT_VIEW_LOOP.flashMax and the picture is never whited (Player.hitFlash put out before the draw). Still no sound and no HUD, no verdict books and no par
// filed (main.ts step), no autosave, no replay buffer. A throw in the game's own step is `none` (the frame loop's fatal card).

   *  and is OUT once the leaf is thrown, and so is the pool lamp (`pool`: the share of itself it burns at under the thrown leaf — it was one more
   *  light, a second shadow of him, and lost in the slab anyway; back with the restage) — so he has ONE long shadow. The room's own lamps burn
   *  at `room` of themselves from then (1: full, as through the slit — under the roof that stays on they add nothing to the yard's floor; the
   *  seam to take them down at a way where they come out through the doorway as a flood).
   *  IT READS AS "CAUGHT" BY ITS SHAPE: a WEDGE with the doorway's shape, not a slab. `past` was 0.75 and pulled the lamp to 0.15 m behind the
   *  wall: a fan 75 deg wide that filled the yard. At 0.25 the lamp hangs about 0.35 m back and the fan runs from just past straight out of the
   *  door to about 53 deg toward him — its edge crosses the floor a quarter metre beyond his place, so he stands lit just inside it, and the
   *  floor along the wall behind him and all the floor on the door's far side stay dark. (Further back is a narrower, door-shaped fan that
   *  MISSES him: he rests a body's width off the wall, 1.1 m along — at 1.0 m back the edge falls 0.84 m along at his distance.)
   *  AND HE IS FROZEN in it: where he stood as the row ended, no walk home under the hold, up out of the crouch from the cost's first frame (as
   *  the room flares behind the leaf: he is standing when it is thrown) and ALL of him turned to the door — his aim at `aimY` m up its middle
   *  and his body's own yaw asked round to it too, at `turn` deg/s (a start, not the calm rows' 100 and 150): a throw leaves his gun on the
   *  door and his feet 50 deg off it, and the game turns only the chest to an aim that near — he stood twisted, which read as a stride.
   *  ITS BRIGHTNESS (`lamp.intensity`): at 48 the wedge's core was twice the pool on a clear floor, but a frag's own smoke stands in the doorway
   *  under it and took a third of that; at 64 the core under a frag is where the old slab's was */

/** THE PACE (the owner's recording, 10-14: on a 120 Hz display the picture's presents alternated 8 ms and 25 ms): an even 60 a second beats an uneven
 *  80. Every n-th display frame is stepped and drawn — the rest are passed over whole (main.ts frame(): the clock is not touched, so the next frame's step
 *  takes the real time since the last). Read off the rAF stamps alone (no thread time: what the GPU costs is seen the only way the page can, a late rAF):
 *  THE PERIOD: a rAF after work that ran long comes a whole number of periods later, so only a frame PASSED OVER shows one period — the first frames at
 *  boot are passed over until eight gaps have been read (`probe` at most), and the period is those gaps over the periods they span (`fastest`), read again
 *  off a fuller window `settle` gaps later, then KEPT. A faster one is taken as it is seen; a slower one (the window moved to a slower display) only by a
 *  PEEK — no gap near the period for `lost` s: frames are passed over until one is (the same display: asked half as often each time, to `lostMax`) or
 *  `peek` of them have shown another. THE BASE n: the rate over the target, `edge` under a whole number rounds up to it (60 to 100 Hz: every frame; 120,
 *  144, 165: every second; 180: every third; 240: every fourth) — never a pace under 57 a second: the quality ladder (ui/quality.ts, fed the gap between
 *  WORKED frames by main.ts) cuts the render scale under 57.9 at its default aim, and the pacer's own choice must not read as a slow machine there.
 *  A SLOW MACHINE is judged by the gaps between worked frames alone: over `late` of a `secs` window's frames more than n periods long, and it stays so
 *  (over `ease` of that) for `hold` s on end, the last `fresh` s too — it cannot hold this pace — and n goes up by ONE (90 Hz to an even 45 before 30),
 *  never past the count that gives `floor` a second. A hitch of 2 s (a frag, a restage) moves nothing; nor does one late frame in ten. BACK: after `stay`
 *  s one step up is tried; a try dropped again inside `proof` s doubles `stay`; after `tries` of those it is tried every `again` s only — never parked
 *  for good — until the load is said to have changed (`eased`: the ladder moved the render scale). A period that reads as a whole multiple or part of the
 *  old one may be the same display seen through late frames: the pace in ms and the tries are kept across it. Pure but for its own state. */
