// AFTER A SAVE KEPT IN MEMORY IS PUT BACK (game/savestate.ts Checkpoints.loadMem → game/rollback.ts restoreSnapshot): the simulation is the saved moment's to the
// bit, and the HOST is still the abandoned moment's. A snapshot reaches the CPU box world, the light set, the decal list and the character renderer's rows — and
// with them their books of WHAT WAS LAST SENT to the GPU, which go back while the buffers do not: left alone, the next upload finds nothing changed and a wall
// blown since the save stays drawn and traced as blown. So every such book is forgotten here and the next frame writes its buffer whole; what lives on the GPU
// alone (smoke in the air, particles) is let go, as a file's load lets it go; the picture's history is cut. One call, by whoever stood the Game up over a real
// device (host/standup.ts wires it; the headless harness has no buffers to be wrong).
