// THE TWO STANDS OF THE QA HARNESS, and the one list of what separates them.
//
//   frozen   (the default)   the stand every frozen digest, tally, probe bound and session fixture was recorded on: tools/qa/headless.ts and standGame's harness block
//                            hold the newer rules off, each by its own line (`pinned()` below is asked by every one of them).
//   shipped  (TPS_PROFILE=shipped in the environment)   the stand the PAGE gives a player who opens it with no URL flag on a machine that has kept nothing: none of
//                            those lines runs, so every table is left at its module's own default — which is what the page plays — and `shippedBoot()` writes the few
//                            rows the page's boot (src/main.ts) writes over those defaults. A pin whose own env word IS given still holds (TPS_PROFILE=shipped
//                            TPS_MOVES=0 = as shipped but for the movement pass), and `--set` rows land after either stand. One exception: a PLAY-THROUGH
//                            (tools/qa/playthrough.ts) writes the door rules and the chaos itself after the stand-up, on either stand — there those rows are
//                            changed with `--set`, never with ONEWAY / QA_DOORSTAY / QA_FRAMEHOLDS / QA_DOORMANNERS / QA_DOORBLAST / QA_EXITSOUT.
//
// The page's own boot writes its URL switches through `pageSwitches` below, the same function the shipped stand calls. What a game module reads off the URL as it
// loads, or keeps per machine, cannot be shared that way, so the page is also HELD to the stand: `node tools/qa/shipped-page.cjs` boots the real page, reads every
// knob table off it (window.__knobs) and compares them with the harness stood up under TPS_PROFILE=shipped (about three minutes a page on the software adapter:
// run it when a boot switch or a page-only default is added); `probes.ts shipped` checks, without a page, that the two harness stands differ in exactly the rows
// FROZEN_HOLDS names. A rule that ships on and is pinned off for the frozen checks is added to
// FROZEN_HOLDS in the same change, or that probe is red.
//
// What 'shipped' still is not: the player (the play-through's commander is scripted and cannot be hurt), the GPU's light meter and smoke sight lines (headless: the
// CPU stand-in, no smoke), a machine's own kept choices (localStorage), V8 (bun runs JavaScriptCore), the game's own die (the page's game owns a seeded die,
// src/math/dice.ts; a harness game on either stand draws the tool's Math.random as every recorded tally did, unless TPS_SEED=n / standUp({ seed }) asks).
//
// Host-neutral, and every game import below is used inside a function only (src/game/ is one import cycle: nothing here may run a game import as this module loads).
