// THE KIT VIEW'S SET LOADER (the Team & kit picture, src/host/kitView.ts): `kitViewSetLevel(levelData, way) → levelData'`. Where the way being staged names
// a BESPOKE SET (scene/scenarios.ts KitViewSet — the owner, 10-15: "feel free to make a bespoke set for the gear screen if there isn't a good existing one in
// the level already. it should then just show off the vibe of the level / be recognizable"), the `?kitview` page loads the SET's boxes, doors and lights
// INSTEAD of the level's geometry and keeps what makes the level the level. main.ts bootLevel calls it between parseLevelData and loadLevel, under `?kitview`
// only; a way with no set — every level today — gets the very object it handed in, so nothing downstream can differ.
//
// PURE, as the planner beside it (kitViewPlan.ts): plain level data in, plain level data out; no Math.random, no clock, no DOM, no import of src/game (one
// runtime import cycle) nor of src/host/kitView.ts. Nothing of the data handed in is written to: what is kept is carried by reference (loadLevel copies).
//
// KEPT, the level's own: `name` (what the weather's snow levels and the look's door paint are keyed by), `version`, `meta`, `floors`, `materials` (the set's
// boxes take the level's paint by name: in a look file, the look's), `surfaces` (the footsteps), `sky`, `daylight` (less the lamps it names that are gone),
// every DIRECTIONAL light (the `moon` the picture's night is read off, a sun) and `scenarios.issue` (a kit, no place). The hour and the weather are the
// query's and are not touched here.
// SWAPPED: `boxes`, `doors` and the lamps are the set's. Box i of the set is box i of the level that loads (kitViewPlan's `hidden` indexes hold).
// GONE: props, switchables, routes (so no shift of guards), chokepoints, civilians, volumes, devices, vents, connectors, beacons, the clear and breach
// plans, and every scenario block but the two below: each of them names a place in the level that is no longer there.
//
// STOOD IN — what the level format (scene/levelData.ts validateLevelData) and the room clear's own check (game/roomclear.ts checkStructure, which is not
// this file's to edit) ask of ANY level, satisfied here and nowhere else:
//   · the breaker's two boxes: two 10 cm boxes sunk 30 m under the floor, AFTER the set's boxes (KIT_SET.panel / .led) — no ray, no raster, no floor;
//   · the mission's three objectives: on the stand-in room below (nobody plays the solo thread in a picture);
//   · `scenarios.roomClear`: the picture is a room clear (the child stages on `game.roomClear`). Its `team` is the PLAN's five places on the set's `ref`
//     side (Sam, then four marks: all on free floor by the plan's own test), repeated as `starts` so that way k of the block is still way k of the game;
//     ONE room (KIT_SET.room): a 2 m square of free floor a man can walk to from the team, behind the anchor where there is any, 3 m at least from every
//     place of the team; one man on it (the child parks every defender far off and dark at every frame, as on a level); its two doors are the set's own —
//     the one leaf named twice where the set has one (the check wants a room with two ways in), and where the set has no leaf at all (an open gate, a blank
//     wall) ONE stand-in leaf in the corner of the world furthest from the anchor (KIT_SET.door): over 20 m off, never seen on a GPU.
// WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE: the page. That the set is DRAWN, that its doorway can be walked (a doorway is free floor on the nav grid only where its middle
// falls near a 0.5 m cell's middle), and anything the child still reads off a level's own names are the wiring step's and tools/qa/kitview-plan.ts's rows.
