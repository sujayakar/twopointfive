// box's whole cross-section; the fragment stage then DISCARDS whatever lies outside the solid — a box-face fragment beyond any cut plane, a cut-face fragment
// outside the box or beyond another plane. Along a pixel's ray a convex solid is entered through exactly one of its planes, at a point inside all the others, so
// exactly one front-facing fragment survives per covered pixel (CUT_KEEP of slack keeps the shared edges closed) and the depth buffer holds the solid's true
