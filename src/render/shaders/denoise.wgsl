// The v3 denoiser CORE (renderer v3 phase 3): ONE reprojection / accumulation / variance / à-trous machinery, THREE clients —
//   SHADOW    the direct pass's two emitter classes (full internal res), denoised in VISIBILITY-RATIO space r = S/U per channel: U (the exact unshadowed
//             light) never enters a history or a filter tap, so a light switching, sweeping or flashing is exact and immediate — only the stochastic
//             visibility is accumulated and smoothed. Input per class: S.rgb + the signed PCSS penumbra hint (S.a), U.rgb (direct.wgsl / restir.wgsl —
//             the same four textures either estimator writes). Output: S = U × r̂ back into the S textures composite / fgather read, hint kept in .a.
//   DIFFUSE   the ⅓ / ½-res final gather's irradiance E (fgather.wgsl outIndirect) → the gi texture composite upsamples.
//   SPECULAR  the gather's specular field (glossy floors + glass, outSpecular: rgb + the reflection ray's hit distance in .a) → the spec texture.
// Per client, per frame:
//   TEMPORAL  reproject the pixel's surface point through last frame's view-projection PLUS the g-buffer's per-pixel object motion (gVel — a walking
//             man's lit shoulder finds its own history, not the wall's behind him), fetch the 2×2 history texels round that point and validate EACH by
//             the view depth it stored against the depth this point had last frame (a partial footprint renormalises over the valid taps = 'fallback to
//             the closest valid'; none valid = disocclusion, history length 0), track per-pixel first / second MOMENTS of the incoming sample's luminance
//             (→ the temporal variance of the SAMPLES: high forever inside a penumbra or under 4-ray bounce, zero where every ray agrees) and the history
//             LENGTH n (capped per tier), accumulate at α = 1/n, and CLAMP the history into this frame's 5×5 neighbourhood statistics (mean ± k·σ, from a
//             workgroup-memory apron — the transient rule: whatever this frame cannot see in its own neighbourhood leaves the history now, so a muzzle
//             flash's visibility, a door's light, a torch sweeping on are this-frame events, exactly the property dtemporal.wgsl had); the diffuse client
//             also keeps a FAST history (short EMA) and centres its clamp box on it (ReLAX: kills the lag of a long history without the boil of clamping to
//             one raw frame). Under 4 frames of history the variance is the spatial one of the apron (SVGF's fallback).
//   À-TROUS   N iterations (per tier) of the 3×3 edge-stopped wavelet at strides 1, 2, 4, 8, 16: weight = B-spline tap × plane distance (depth) × normal
//             power × LUMINANCE similarity relative to the pixel's own σ = sqrt(variance) (SVGF: smooth where the estimate is noisy, keep every edge the
//             estimate is sure of — a crisp contact shadow beside a wide penumbra stays crisp), the variance filtered along (Σw²var / (Σw)²); the shadow
//             client also weighs taps 'lit alike' (never mix ratios across a cone edge / between light footprints — softblur's rule) and keeps softblur's
//             hint prior as the kernel's REACH: an iteration only takes a pixel as far as its own / inherited penumbra width asks (contact hardening from
//             the blocker distance, dilated stride by stride like the hint always was) — and its final iteration multiplies U back in.

// ---- the OCCLUDED-LIGHT reading (flags bit 64, settings.dnShadowOccl) ----
// The ratio r = S/U is only smooth where the lights of a class share their visibility. A light that is in U but HIDDEN from the pixel — a guard's torch on the other side of a
// wall, a few metres off and a hundred times brighter unshadowed than the lamp that does light the floor — puts its whole footprint into the denominator: r = S_rest / (U_rest + T)
// then carries the torch's cone, falloff and every step it takes, although S has none of it. Averaging such ratios (over taps, or over frames while the torch bobs) and multiplying
// the exact U back in does not return S: it returns S × (U here now) × mean(1/U) — the beam's shape, faint, on the far side of the wall (a thin bright arc along the cone's edge
// where another light shows the floor, a pale wedge walking with the guard; the maintainer, 10-10: "very subtle artifacting for flashlights that goes through occluders").
// Two readings of another sample (a tap q, or the history) of ratio r_q taken under U_q, seen from a pixel under U_c: SAME VISIBILITY (the lights that differ between them are as
// visible as the rest: r_q stands — the filter as it was) and OCCLUDED (they are hidden: S is what carries over, r_q × U_q/U_c). Both are physical and everything between them is
// a partly hidden light, so the sample is read as the point of that segment NEAREST the centre's own evidence (the à-trous: its ratio; the history: see shTemporal): where the occluded reading does not bring
// the sample closer — every visible light: a lit pixel's ratio rises with U, the occluded reading says it falls — nothing changes, and where U is the same on both sides (no
// carried light near, nothing flickering) the factor is exactly 1. The result never leaves the span between the sample and the evidence, so it adds no value the filter did not
// already hold.
// The same bit also governs shTemporal's NEIGHBOURHOOD STATISTICS (stats5Sh): a texel where the class has no light at all carries the prior, not a measurement, and is left out
// of the 5×5 mean / σ, and the history clamp's box always holds the pixel's own sample.
