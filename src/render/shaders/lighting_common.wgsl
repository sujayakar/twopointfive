// no rays: (1) the offset never carries the read past the plane of (P0, N0) — that plane IS a wall (or floor) between Ph and everything behind it; (2) the trilinear
// footprint of the point read: any lattice neighbour whose cell centre lies behind that plane collapses onto the read point's own cell centre on that axis, and if that
// centre itself lies behind the plane (a wall off the metre lattice) the read steps to the first cell centre on P0's side. Identical to the plain read wherever the hit

// another room. Neither holds for a man. His side that faces a wall he stands by has a hand's width of air, and a spacing along its normal is the room behind that
// wall; the plane of his own skin has open ground behind it, so diceIrradianceFrom's "the cell centre is behind the wall: step to the cell on P0's side" stepped a ray
// that left him for the wall THROUGH the wall. Men standing in the snow at the foot of a lit room's outer wall took the room's bounce on the side that faces the

// inside a wall is not seen: a probe there is dark). .w = 0: it sees none of them (the point is inside a box — a proxy through a wall, a door leaf): no read,
// which is dark, never the room. Five to eight short box rays; asked only where a man is the face read for or the surface the ray left is no wall (bounceHitMan,
