// the pass draws this once a man, each with his own owner, ink and width), read off the g-buffer's
// id target — every pixel there carries the owner of what was drawn into it (gbuffer.wgsl: bits 20–27; his body, his kit and his gun alike), so the rim is
// his silhouette as this frame drew it, at any zoom and in any pose. One triangle over the composite, blended, inside a scissor round him: a pixel that is
// not his takes the ink by how near the nearest of his pixels is — and only from one that stands IN FRONT of it (the g-buffer's depth, smaller = nearer),
// so a wall top, a table or a teammate between him and the camera is not drawn on; a pixel that is his is left as the picture made it.
