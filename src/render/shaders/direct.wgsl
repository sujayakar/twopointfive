// Full-resolution direct lighting, history-free. One estimator for every light:
//   per pixel, every light is scored unshadowed (analytic, exact); lights fall into two classes — SHARP emitters
//   (torches, bulb, moon, muzzle flashes: narrow penumbrae) and BROAD ones (ceiling panels, screens, street lamps);
//   per class the strongest lights (2 sharp / 3 broad) get one shadow ray each to a random point on their emitter; the
//   rest of the class (the tail) gets ONE importance-picked shadow ray of its own (negligible tails ride on the leaders' visibility) instead of a ray of its
//   own — deterministic, so the only noise left for the denoiser is area-sampling noise inside real penumbrae. Each
//   class writes S (shadowed estimate), U (exact unshadowed total) and a signed penumbra-width hint (PCSS-style, from
//   the blocker distance). Cost is bounded by the per-class leader budget plus one tail ray, not by the light count no matter how many lights are on, transients need no
//   special casing, and there is no history anywhere in the direct path. The scoring itself is per 8x8 tile restricted — losslessly —
//   to the lights that can reach the tile's bounds at all (FLAG_TILECULL, below). Optionally (FLAG_CHECKER_DIRECT, lossy, off by default)
//   only a checkerboard half of the pixels trace shadow rays each frame and the other half reconstruct VISIBILITY from them (bottom).
