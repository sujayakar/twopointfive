// scene.globalsY               = the same padded extent per global, in metres (globalMissesY)
//
// Why both are exact (same hit.t / idx / code, same occlusion answers, flag on or off):
//  * Empty runs. An empty cell has no items, so not loading its (equal) start/end pair changes nothing; a cell at Chebyshev distance d from
//    every occupied cell is followed, whatever the ray does, by d−1 more cells within d−1 king moves of it — all empty too. The DDA still takes
//    exactly one loop iteration per cell with the very same float stepping and the same break tests, so `iter` counts what it always counted
//    (and GRID_W + GRID_H ≤ 96 is asserted host-side: a ray leaves the grid after at most W + H steps, the cap never binds either way).
//  * Height cull. Every test the cull drops is one that could not have changed anything. The DDA visits the cells along the ray in t order and
//    a box is registered in every cell its footprint overlaps, so by the time the walk enters cell k at tCell, any box that the ray meets at a
//    point BEHIND tCell was already met in the (earlier) cell holding that point: traceClosest already has hit.t ≤ that t (the re-test is a
//    no-op under the strict <), occluded / occludedT already returned. What is left are hits ahead, at t in [tCell, tEnd] (tEnd = tmax, or the
//    current hit.t), i.e. at heights between y(tCell) and y(tEnd) — inside the box, hence inside its stored [ymin, ymax], hence inside the
//    cell's mask. A cell whose mask misses the quantised span, or an item whose extent misses it, therefore only ever produced misses / no-ops,
//    and dropping those leaves the sequence of state-changing tests, their order and the hit state they see untouched (ties included). The
//    4 cm pad on the stored extents dwarfs everything float in y: f32 vs f64 quantiser boundaries (~1e-7 m), y(t) rounding (~1e-5 m), the
//    drift of the accumulated tNext against the true cell lines (< 1e-4 m of height over a whole ray), corner tie attribution (~1e-6 m).
//    "Registered in every cell it can be hit in" is true of the f64 footprint, but the box the GPU traces is made of f32 centres / half sizes /
//    origin offsets and, when yawed, f16 cos/sin: its faces can sit up to scene.grid.x metres (measured per build; ~1e-5 axis-aligned, mm for a
//    yawed car) outside the registered cells. A ray grazing such a sliver meets the box just BEFORE the line into its first registered cell,
//    i.e. up to slack/|rd ⟂ line| behind tCell — so the span a cell is judged by starts that far back (tBack: slack × the tDelta of the axis
//    just stepped, which is exactly 1/|rd ⟂|), clamped to the DDA start. For all but grazing rays that is a few micrometres of extra height.
//    (Nothing can lie behind the DDA start itself: every caller's origin is inside WORLD_MIN/MAX, so t0 = 0 — an origin-inside answer comes
//    from the start cell, whose span holds ro.y — and an origin outside the world has no box before its entry point.)
//  * Tighter spans (FLAG_GRID_SLABS). Tallying those terms: the y-cull needs the stored extents to out-reach the tracer by the accumulated tNext
//    drift (≤ 68 steps × ½ ulp(64 m) ≈ 2.6e-4 m of height), y(t) and cell-entry rounding (~2e-5), the f32-vs-f64 quantiser inputs (~2e-6) and
//    the ~2e-5 by which a reported hit can sit outside its box (below) — under 3.5e-4 m in all — and they carry 4 cm. So the span a cell is judged
//    by may be pulled in by scene.grid.y = 4 cm − 5 mm at BOTH ends without a hittable box failing either per-end test (each end was argued on
//    its own above), still with a 5 mm margin, 14× the tally. When the pull-in crosses the ends over (a span under 7 cm: level rays), qlo > qhi
//    only makes both per-item tests stricter, and an item passing both has qmin ≤ qhi < qlo ≤ qmax — its slices cover the whole hull [qhi, qlo] —
//    so the cell is walked only if its mask holds EVERY hull slice (an ordered span: any). That is what stops a ray lifted 1–2 cm off a desk,
//    floor finish or wall top by its pass from slab-testing the surface it just left (its padded band reached up past the origin; nothing
//    else about the walk changes).
//  * Globals by segment bounds (FLAG_GRID_SLABS). If isectBox reports t ≥ 0 for box b there is a t* ∈ [0, tmax] (the reported t, or 0 from
//    inside) lying in every axis' slab interval, and the point ro + rd·t* taken exactly sits within |lo| · 3·2⁻²⁴ + ½ ulp ≈ 2e-5 m of the box
//    on each axis (lo = ro − c and the two slab distances are each one rounding off; yaw 0 makes the local frame the world frame bit for bit, a
//    yawed global's f16 outline is inside footprint + slack by construction of the slack). Every coordinate of that point also lies between ro
//    and pEnd = ro + rd·tmax as computed (affine in t; pEnd is off by ≤ two roundings below 128 m ≈ 1.5e-5). So a global whose bounds — footprint and height
//    extent + slack + 5 mm (boxes.ts GLOBAL_PAD) — clear [min(ro, pEnd), max(ro, pEnd)] on ANY axis cannot report a hit: 5 mm against < 4e-5.
//    A skipped global answered "miss" before, and a miss moves nothing in any of the three queries (closest: no state; any-hit: no early out),
//    so the survivors run in the same order against the same state. The old test was this on y alone with 4 cm: every ray lifted 1–2 cm off a
//    floor still slab-tested all four floor-level globals (ground, carpet base, two finishes) — four of its ~ten box tests — for nothing.

/** (in-scatter rgb, transmittance a) between the eye and distance `dist` along the ray through `uv`, from the integrated froxel volume `vt` — biased frame.froxelC.w
 *  slices toward the eye so a surface never collects scatter injected behind it (the froxel it sits in straddles it). ACROSS the screen the fetch is a cubic
 *  B-spline (four trilinear taps — Sigg & Hadwiger's offsets): a froxel is a dozen pixels wide, and the trilinear kernel alone shows every froxel boundary as
 *  a crease along a beam's edge; the B-spline is C² across them (softer by half a froxel, never creased). Along the ray it stays linear (that axis is the eye's own). */
