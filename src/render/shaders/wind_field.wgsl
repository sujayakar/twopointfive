// ---- THE WIND FIELD (rust/game_rules/src/wind): the air's velocity from ONE source at a point — the analytic supply-vent JET and the STORM outdoors. This one text is compiled
// into BOTH GPU consumers (render/particles.ts prepends it to the particle kernels, smoke/smoke.ts to the solver's), and rust/game_rules/src/wind jet_vel / stormVel repeat it
// on the CPU (windAt: the moths, the panel, the probes) — three copies of one small model; tools/qa wind-probes compares the constants and the CPU numbers. No
// bindings, no structs of either consumer: plain functions of plain arguments, so the two blocks that carry the records (particles_common.wgsl ImpulseRec in its
// 'wind' mode, smoke/wind_force.wgsl WindSrc) can lay them out as suits them.
//
// The JET (a diffuser at `pos` blowing along unit `dir` at `speed` m/s at its face): straight streamlines out of the cone's virtual apex (r0 = the core's radius at
// the face, tanSpread its half-angle), speed × 1/(1 + (d/reach)²) down the axis × a Gaussian e^(−(r/σ)²) across it (σ = r0 + d·tanSpread), cut smoothly to nothing
// over the last 30 % of dMax and outside 2.6 σ (a bounded support: a solver cell or a leaf outside it does exactly nothing); a jet blowing DOWN at a floor turns
// to run out along it below WIND_DEFLECT_H over it (the impinging jet's wall jet — what slides a leaf lying under a diffuser instead of pinning it) and is nothing
// under that floor. `floorY` ≤ −100 = no floor. The STORM: the weather's wind vector everywhere OUTDOORS (outside the two roofed footprints, under
// WIND_STORM_TOP), easing in over the first metre and a half off the facade (the wall's lee) and slower along the ground. ROOF BY ROOF (windStormRoofs; rust/game_rules/src/wind
// WX_OWN.wind): a level of three or four roofs of its own used to hand windStorm their BOUNDING BOX as its one footprint — on a level built round a yard that box is
// the yard, and nothing outdoors there had any wind. With that rule on the storm record of such a level carries all four footprints and the storm blows wherever
// none of them is overhead, easing in off whichever is nearest; a level of one or two roofs still calls windStorm, with the rectangles it always had.
