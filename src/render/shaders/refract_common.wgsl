// REFRACTION helpers — pure functions, NO bindings and no dependence on the scene prelude: prepended by whoever bends a ray through a clear medium and reads the
// already-shaded picture behind it in screen space. Today: composite.wgsl (the glass boxes — panes and the water-cooler bottle: glassRefractPath / refractedRead)
// and the particle rain's water streaks (particles_draw.wgsl, exp/prain). Each caller does its own READS (the shaded scene, the depth) with what it binds; the law,
// the box exit, the absorption, the re-projection and the screen guards live here once.
//
// The model both share: Snell in (refractDir, η = n_from / n_to), the medium crossed analytically (slabExit for a box; a cylinder's chord for a streak), Snell out
// (a face met past the critical angle mirrors the ray instead — total internal reflection — and the caller crosses once more), Beer–Lambert by the length crossed
// (the medium given as its transmittance through a reference length), then the exit ray's continuation READ where a point along it projects
// (refractProbeDist → screenRefractPx → clampRefractOffset), the caller refusing the read where what shows there is nearer than the exit point or is the sky.
