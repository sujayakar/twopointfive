// GBAA — geometry-buffer anti-aliasing (Persson 2011), the image-quality program's single-frame edge AA (docs/internal/image-quality.md §C3).
// The g-buffer's box raster writes, per pixel, the signed distance in PIXELS from the pixel centre to the nearest silhouette / crease edge of the box face it shows,
// along the screen axis that edge is most nearly perpendicular to (gbuffer.wgsl boxEdgeOffset → the `edge` target, rg8unorm, d·½+½; a component ≥ ½ in magnitude =
// no edge crosses this pixel along that axis). Here, per pixel of the composite (hdr):
//   1. its own offset; if no edge crosses it, the four neighbours': a left neighbour whose edge lies ½‥1 px to ITS right has that edge inside this pixel at
//      l − 1, etc. — the pixel on the far side of a silhouette shows the OTHER surface and knows nothing of the edge, so the near side lends it;
//   2. the far side of the edge (a slab 0.5 − |d| of the pixel wide) belongs to whatever the neighbour across it shows: blend toward that neighbour by exactly that
//      coverage — in the reversible tonemapped space the TAA resolve weighs in (an emissive panel's edge against a dark desk averages as it will look, not in raw
//      radiance where the bright side always wins the pixel).
// SAME-SURFACE CLAMP (lane v3/direct-quality, frame.sharpCfgC.w = settings.gbaaClamp): the far side of a pixel's own edge belongs to the neighbour across it only if that neighbour
// is AT or BEHIND this pixel — the far side of a silhouette (metres back) or the other face of a crease (the same depth to a few cm). A neighbour NEARER than the pixel is a third
// surface standing over the edge (a man before a partition's top edge, a chair back across a desk's lip): its colour is not what the sliver beyond the edge shows, and lending it
// put half of him into every edge pixel his outline crossed — a rim of his colour along the furniture behind him. Such a pixel keeps its own colour (0 = the blend as it was).
// Analytic coverage from exact geometry: no history, no jitter, no search — an edge in motion is as clean as one at rest. Skinned men, glass panes and
// intersection lines (a box sunk into another) carry no edge here (their pixels write NONE) and are left to the temporal resolve as before. Runs after the
// composite (+ the particles' splat) and before the resolve, IN PLACE on hdr: the host copies hdr → hdrCopy first, this reads the copy and stores hdr.
