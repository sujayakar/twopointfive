// HOW DESTRUCTION DUST IS DRAWN (look only). Compiled into ONE program: the volumetric pass's dust twin (render/dustLookVol.ts builds it from volumetrics.wgsl's own
// text; passes.ts dispatches it only on frames some brick of smoke carries dust). volumetrics.wgsl, common.wgsl and every other module are not touched: with no dust
// alive the frame runs the programs it always ran.
//
// WHOSE smoke is dust is per CELL: the atlas texel carries it (smoke/smoke.wgsl publish): .x the density every reader takes, .yzw that density × (1 − tint) averaged over whatever
// is in the cell. So dust drifting into a canister's plume tints and shapes only where it is, in proportion, and the plume beside it stays white smoke. Where a cell is dust, in
// the VIEW march only, the density the eye integrates is the solver's × a shape that
//   (1) THINS THE CLOUD WHERE IT ENDS: a sample whose neighbourhood, a noise-varied 0.2‥0.5 m out, holds less than it does is at the cloud's edge and is drawn
//       thinner — a front of dust, 2 s after a bang, was drawn as an egg with a firm rim because the field is as dense at its surface as in its middle;
//   (2) frays the faintest veil;
//   (3) breaks the body into slow billows (mean kept): the coarse lattice's field in a filled room is smooth, and smooth lit fog reads as one flat blob;
// the in-scatter takes the tint, weighted by whose density is at the sample (gypsum is not white smoke; plain smoke sharing the ray keeps its white); and where the
// sample is dust the march's own self-shadow taps read the same drawn density, so a billow has a lit side and a fold.
// EVERY OTHER READER IS UNTOUCHED: the scene's shadow rays, the haze's and the froxels' smoke terms, and above all the light probe's sight lines read .x through
// smoke_read.wgsl like any smoke, so this file cannot move a sight line. The price, said plainly: the picture and the sight lines no longer read
// the very same field in a dust cloud — the outer 0.2‥0.5 m of a cloud and its thinnest veil are drawn thinner than a man's sight line (and the cloud's shadow on
// the floor) reads them, and through the body a ray crossing a billow's crest is drawn denser, one crossing a trough thinner, than the smooth field the sight line reads (the same on
// average). The K = 0 march (no row ships it) draws dust as plain smoke.
const DUST_SOFT_M: f32 = 0.36;      // the reach (m, × 0.55‥1.45 by the noise) over which a cloud's edge thins: the four taps that find where the cloud ends sit this far out
