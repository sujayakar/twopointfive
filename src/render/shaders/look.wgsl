// THE LOOK PROTOTYPE (the page /look; render/frame.ts lookConfig, the scene prelude's const `LOOK`): THE MATERIAL LOOK, as STYLE.md's Surfaces now allows it (a box
// has a paint and a material; the material is maps the page makes itself). On that page only until it is landed on the game's. This file is in the g-buffer module ONLY on that page (render/gbuffer.ts lookWgsl); every other page gets a stub.
//
// What it does to a box pixel, in the g-buffer and nowhere else:
//   MAPS      tiling materials (and two of masonry), each made by the page the first time a box is that stuff (render/gbuffer.ts needLook; render/lookTex.ts: paint, height, normal, roughness, cavity), picked by what the box SAYS it is made of
//             (its word in its own record: common.wgsl boxStuff, scene/stuff.ts; no colour is asked) and laid in metres: along a wall and up it, world x z on the ground, along the long
//             side of a board or a sheet, and in the box's own frame for cloth, bare metal and old paint (a sack carries its weave with it) AND FOR ANYTHING THAT
//             MOVES, whatever it is made of (a box past the level's statics: a door's leaf, a shoved crate, a jar; common.wgsl boxLook). A layer varies a box's
//             paint and never moves its value: its multiplier and its hollows each average to 1 over a tile (lookTex.ts lookLayer).
//   UNTILE    a stuff that has no courses (its row's `untiles`) is read twice, the second turned and shifted, and cross-faded by a slow noise and
//             by height, so a 2 m map does not print its repeat on a 40 m yard. A stuff MADE OF PIECES deals its map's pieces over the world instead
//             (lookDeal), is laid in bays (lookPiece), and a kept place drifts a shade over ten metres.
//   MASONRY   a mud wall's stone plinth and the mud brick where its render has fallen: two more maps, laid by the wall's own height and length.
//   WEATHER   what follows the BUILDING, not the map: damp and dirt climbing a wall's foot to a ragged line, a bleached head and the runs under it, slow blotches;
//             on the ground the level's own traffic map (render/wear.ts) — walked earth packed pale and smooth, dirt and stones gathered where nobody walks,
//             against the walls.
//   RELIEF    the map's normal, stood on the face. The g-buffer keeps the TILTED normal with alpha 0 (the target's spare code); gdown hands every working-size
//             pass the box's own face back (common.wgsl lookGeoN), so the filters, the gather and the reservoirs see the flat wall they always saw, and only the
//             screen-size direct light (sharp_direct.wgsl) and the composite's sky share light the relief.
//   EDGES     a small box's arrises are rounded in the normal and rubbed pale: a crate stops being twelve triangles.
//   SNOW      on a snow level (snow.wgsl's field is live), lookSnow below: snow blown against the foot of what stands in the open, and lying on what was left out.
// Numbers the page's panel moves live: lookCfg (render/gbuffer.ts setLook).
