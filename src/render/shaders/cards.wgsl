// Torch bounce cards (FLAG_BOUNCE_CARDS; render/passes.ts dispatches one workgroup per nominated light, k < frame.cardCfg.x, right before the final gather).
//
// The problem: a torch held near a wall lights a patch a few tens of centimetres across to hundreds of W/m². The final gather finds that patch with K = 4
// cosine rays per half-res pixel — one ray in a few hundred from the floor beside it lands in it and brings back ~50× what its neighbours bring — so the
// bounce round every torch near a wall boils, and the relative firefly bound (giFireflyK) that tames it throws away up to a quarter of that bounce.
//
// The fix, by construction: the lit patch becomes an ANALYTIC emitter for the one bounce, exactly the way an area-lit fixture's glow is carried by its
// kind-3 light instead of by rays that happen to hit the box. Per nominated spot light (kind 1, `card` lights: torches, weapon lights, Sam's rail light):
//   1. lane 0 traces the beam axis from the lens (the carrier's own boxes / capsules skipped, as every shadow ray toward this light skips them) to the first
//      surface: centre C (ON the surface), normal n, distance t. No card when it hits nothing within CARD_TMAX, a character (capsule: curved, moving), or at
//      grazing incidence. The CLAIM REGION W = { x : |(x − C)·n| < CARD_PLANE_EPS, normal(x)·n > CARD_COS_MIN, |x − C|² − ((x − C)·n)² < R² } with
//      R = min(CARD_RMAX, 1.15 · t · tan(outer) / cos(incidence)) — the outer cone's footprint on that plane, and a little over.
//   2. all 64 lanes trace one direction each, stratified uniformly in solid angle over the outer cone (ΔΩ = 2π(1 − cosO)/64 per sample), and keep the
//      samples whose hit lies in W. FLUX: for a point source of intensity I(ω) the power through dω is I dω whatever surface it lands on (E = I cosθ / d², and
//      dA = d² dω / cosθ), so sample j carries  Φ_j = colour·I0 · smoothstep(cosO, cosI, cosα_j) · window(d_j) · ΔΩ  — the very factors evalLight applies for
//      this light (the 1/max(d², r²) core is 1/d² here: d ≫ the lens radius) — times the smoke transmittance along it when smoke is up (what the direct pass's
//      shadow rays would let through). A diffuse surface of albedo ρ turns irradiance E into radiosity ρE = π · radiance, so the patch's "radiance × area"
//      (the quantity a kind-3 Light carries in .color) is  Φ_L = Σ_j ρ(x_j) ⊙ Φ_j / π.  Energy check: the patch re-emits π·Φ_L = ρ·(flux landed in W). ✓
//      Flux that lands OUTSIDE W (past R, on the floor under a wall spot, on a man standing in the beam, on a box in front of the wall) is not claimed —
//      and the gather does not exclude it either (fgather.wgsl tests the same predicate, `onCard` in common.wgsl), so it stays with the rays: the card
//      and the exclusion agree on W by construction, for ANY R. R only trades how much of the boil is removed against how well a disc stands in for the patch.
//   3. the flux-weighted centroid Cq and RMS radius rq of the kept samples place the gather's 4-point quadrature where the light actually is (a spot's
//      smoothstep profile is centre-heavy; a beam half over a wall's edge is lopsided).
// Rows written per card k (texel x = k): 0 = (C, R) · 1 = (n, slot) · 2 = (Φ_L rgb, rq) · 3 = (Cq, 1). No card: R = 0 and Φ_L = 0 (row 1 still names
// the slot, rows are always fully written). Cost: 8 × 65 short closest-hit traces ≈ nothing; it is timed inside the 'gather' pass it serves.
