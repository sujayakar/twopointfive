// THE AIR FIELD — the wind as a small 2D FLUID over the whole level floor (shaders/air_field.wgsl), for the blown snow to ride. The maintainer on his GPU look at the
// snow level: the blown snow should 'feel like snow blowing around ... chaotic fluid dynamics, not just a single static pattern that lines up with the wind', and
// 'the nice thing of integrating with the fluid system is that you'll naturally get neat interactions where the wind hits a wall', 'like vortices past the edge of
// the door'. So: an incompressible-ish solve on a grid of AIR_RES cells a metre, walls / boxes / door leaves as solid cells, the ambient wind forced in wherever the
// sky is open, and what comes out is a texture of the air's velocity (and an upward LIFT) a cell that the grain particles sample.
// PICTURE ONLY: nothing in the simulation reads it, it takes no die and no wall clock (the caller hands it the game's clock), and it imports nothing from src/game.
// What lives here: the buffers, the one bind group every kernel shares, the numbers (AIR), the step's encoding (one compute pass, 4 + 2 × AIR.iterations small
// dispatches, ONE uniform write), the cell map's upload, the read-back for the test page (tools/qa/air-field-page.cjs) and a debug view.
//
// Three things about the model that are not in a textbook solver (the shader's head has the kernels):
//   THE RELAX   every open cell is pulled toward wind × its share over AIR.relaxTime. That is the wind coming over the wall tops; it is also what makes the field
//               forget (set the wind to 0 and it dies in a few relax times).
//   THE VENT    the pressure equation has a leak ∝ pressure (AIR.vent): air piling up on a wall goes UP and over, air sucked out of a lee is fed from above. Without
//               it 2D air has nowhere to go and a walled yard is dead still whatever the wind; with it a wall shelters AIR.relaxTime / AIR.vent's root in metres
//               (≈ 9 m at the numbers below for the last of it; in the pictures the calm is the first 3 or 4) and the solve is local. The vent's own upward speed is the LIFT channel.
//   THE CHAOS   a cubic advection that keeps small eddies, vorticity confinement that feeds them, and a boiling curl-noise push scaled by the local air speed, so
//               a wake sheds and wanders and no two seconds look alike. All three are gated by what drives the air (the wind, or a source): still air stays still.
//   SOURCES     besides the ambient wind, up to AIR_SRC_MAX local ones (setSources): a gust through an outside door, a wall vent, a ceiling diffuser spreading over
//               the floor. Indoors there may be no wind at all: the caps and gates then go by the strongest source. Under a roof the vent is AIR.roofVent (a
//               ceiling), so a room is nearly strict 2D: a draught in at its door curls and comes back out of it.
// NEVER SEEN ON A GPU: every number below was judged on Chromium's software adapter, from streak pictures of the read-back field (the test page writes them).
