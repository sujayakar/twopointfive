// GPU particles (EXPERIMENT E4 — sparks, debris chips, dust puffs, spent casings): the CPU half. Game code queues EMITS (kind, where, which way, how many, a
// few numbers); once a frame the queue is packed into one uniform block with the ring slots each emit was dealt, and two compute kernels (shaders/
// particles.wgsl) give birth to and step every live particle — gravity, drag, collision against the renderer's own trace grid, sleep, and SHADING (sparks
// off their cooling curve, everything else lit by the light buffer + two shadow rays + the radiance cache) — then one draw splats the live windows into the
// HDR target after the composite (shaders/particles_draw.wgsl), where the bloom picks the hot ones up. What lives here: the pool layout, the two rings and
// their live windows (only those are simulated / drawn: nothing alive = no dispatch, no draw), the per-kind numbers the panel edits, the emit API, the
// IMPULSE API (game events — a stun charge, a round beside settled litter, a thump on the floor — kicking and waking live particles: ≤ MAX_IMPULSES records
// a frame in the same block's tail, uploaded only on frames that carry any, applied by the update kernel; game/sheetModel.ts is the reference of what one
// does), the stats read back from the pool header. Deterministic: every random draw on the GPU hashes (emit / impulse serial, particle index) — no Math.random on the path.
//
// Bindings, against this adapter's budget (10 storage buffers a stage on Chrome/Metal; the scene group already holds 8 in compute / fragment):
//   simulation  group 0 = the scene group (trace grid, lights, reach rows, capsules, mesh trees…: 8 storage) + group 1 = { pool (storage rw), the frame's
//               uniform block, the cascade dice (texture) } → 9 storage buffers in the compute stage;
//   splat       group 0 = the scene group (only `frame` is touched) + group 1 = { pool (read-only storage, VERTEX), the same uniform block, g-buffer depth,
//               the volumetric texture } → +1 storage buffer in the vertex stage (3 with the scene's two `all`-visible ones), +0 in the fragment stage.
