// Per-light REACH masks: for a static light, which 1 m grid cells of the level it can possibly light — and roughly how much of each —
// decided once on the CPU from the level's full-height walls (2D visibility over the XZ plane), 2 bits a cell. The direct pass skips a
// light at a pixel whose cell it cannot reach (exactly as if evalLight had returned !ok there) and RANKS the rest for its leader slots by
// score × how much of the cell the light sees, so a panel glimpsed through a far doorway no longer outranks the room's own lamp; the
// secondary-vertex loop (directIrradiance) takes the skip.
//
// Why: lights are SCORED unshadowed. In a dark room next to lit ones (the break room with its panels off, beside the cubicle floor and
// the corridor), bright ceiling panels behind the walls out-score the room's own dim fixtures, take the per-pixel leader slots, and push
// the local lights into the one-ray importance-sampled tail — whose pick then usually lands on a walled-off panel (visibility 0), so
// whole regions of floor lose a perfectly visible light, with hard contours where the leader set changes (08-08: red / blue vending
// fronts drawing hard arcs across the break-room floor). A light that provably cannot reach the cell never enters the contest.
//
// What the mask guarantees, and what it does not. Every modelling choice errs toward "reaches" — a false "reaches" only costs what it
// costs today (a score and maybe a ray):
//  * only FULL-HEIGHT static occluders count as walls (bottom ≤ WALL_Y0 and top within 10 cm of the ceiling, shadow-casting, unrotated):
//    furniture, counters, cubicle partitions, sills, headers, door jambs and stops, glazing openings and every door leaf (dynamic) are open ground;
//  * every light not registered by the level build (torches, muzzle flashes, the rail light, dropped torches…) and the moon carry an
//    all-ones mask; the street lamps above the roof line get one over the INTERIOR cells only (they enter the building through its openings,
//    but outdoors they overfly walls a 2D raster would say block them);
//  * the light looks out from several source points (its own position and points pushed out along its facing / around it), the start
//    and end sub-cells of every sight line are ignored (a fixture mounted on a wall sits inside that wall's sub-cell column), and a sight
//    line threading the shared corner of two diagonal wall sub-cells slips through.
// But the receiving cell is SAMPLED, not covered: five looks per 1 m cell (its centre and four corner sub-cells, SUBS, on the 1/16 m
// raster), reached if ANY look sees ANY source point. A light that gets into a cell only across a strip lying between those five points
// is level 0 there — dropped outright by direct / directIrradiance / gloss, a hard cut at that cell's edge. The review (docs/internal/
// review-2026-08-08.md #17) counted 36 such cells over lights × cells with an exact 3D raycast, nearly all dim ceiling panels two doorways
// off (worst ~40 % of the local unshadowed score at three cells by panel_cubicles_11; the beacons 13–18 % of theirs in a blackout). The
// one-cell dilation ring (REACH_OPTS.ring) keeps every one of them at level 1 — but on this level 47 % of each mask's footprint was then
// ring-only 'maybe' cells, a far light pickable in one cell and known-dark in the next, which drew the server racks' green halo as arcs on
// the break-room wall (commit 1170839); so the ring is OFF by default: a deliberate trade of a few dim far-panel slivers for no cell-edge
// arcs. Turning it back on wants the consumer side changed first (level 1 = tail-only, never a leader, in direct.wgsl).
