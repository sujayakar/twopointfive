// Decals (EXPERIMENT E1): the marks an encounter leaves on the level — bullet holes, the scorch of a stun charge, boot scuffs on a kicked leaf,
// the pale chip a ring airfoil knocks out of the plaster. NOT geometry and not boxes in the trace grid: a small ring-allocated list on the CPU,
// bucketed into the level's 1 m XZ cells, uploaded (when it changed) as ONE read-only storage buffer that the g-buffer's FRAGMENT stage reads
// (render/shaders/decals.wgsl): for the shaded pixel's world position + face normal + box index it walks its cell's few entries, rejects by
// bounding sphere / facing / plane distance / owning box, and modulates the albedo it writes (darken + tint, a paler chipped rim), tilts the
// normal a little across a crater's bevel, and lowers the albedo target's alpha where soot should kill the polished floors' gloss. Because it is
// the g-buffer albedo / normal that change, everything downstream — the traced direct light, the final gather's bounce AT the pixel, the gloss
// term — responds without knowing decals exist. (What does NOT respond: the bounce OFF a marked surface onto its neighbours — secondary hits
// shade with the box's own material — and the AI's light meter, which is irradiance, not albedo.)
//
// Marks on a DYNAMIC box (a door leaf, a piece of loose furniture) are stored in that box's local frame and re-derived every frame from where
// the box now stands (sync), restricted on the GPU to pixels of that very box; marks on statics are world-fixed and paint any surface that passes
// the facing + plane tests (a scorch runs across the floor slab AND the rug lying on it). Lifetime: the encounter — the ring recycles the oldest
// past CAP, resetLevelState() clears the lot.
//
// One buffer, four regions (word offsets exported to the shader by decalWgslConsts, so both sides read one layout):
//   [0]                       header vec4u: count, list length, serial, 0
//   [CELL0, +CELLS_V4)        the cell table: one u32 per 1 m cell = start16 | count16 into the index list (4 cells a vec4)
//   [LIST0, +LIST_V4)         the index list: decal indices per cell, oldest first (4 a vec4)
//   [REC0, +3·CAP)            the records, 3 vec4 each: (pos.xyz, radius) (normal.xyz, param) (tangent.xyz, bits(kind3 | attached1 | seed12 | box16))
//                             (box16 = the box an attached mark rides, DECAL_ANY_BOX for a world-fixed one, or — kind glassHit — the static index of ITS pane)
//
// Kind 'wetprint' (game/wet.ts): a wet shoe print, param = how wet — the one kind whose record is EDITED after the fact (wet.ts agePrints lowers param as it
// dries and calls touch(); remove() retires it before the ring would).
// Kind 'damage' with param ≥ WEAR_MARK.look (game/wallwear.ts): a WALL-WEAR mark — a round's own 'bullet' record EDITED in place (kind, pos, radius, param; touch())
// into what a breakable shows before it gives. See WEAR_MARK below; decals.wgsl wearMark draws it.
// Kind 'glassHit' (E3 × E1): a round's hole + crack star on a glass pane. Panes are in no raster, so the g-buffer's decalSurface skips the kind outright; it is
// composite.wgsl that evaluates it (glassMarks in decals.wgsl) at the point the view ray crosses the pane, from the same cell lists, and modulates the pane's
// transmission / reflection there. Same ring, same lifetime, same buffer — the composite pass binds it too (passes.ts group 1 binding 10).
