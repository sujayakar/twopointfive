// CUT BOXES — A CALM ROOM PAYS NOTHING (scene/cut.ts cutConfig.swap).
//
// The cut rule is one extra branch in the ray-box test of every tracing program (common.wgsl isectBox behind the scene prelude's `const CUT_BOXES`). Whether a GPU
// pays for a branch nobody takes cannot be measured where this was written, so the build does not ask it to: every pipeline BOOTS from the prelude without the rule
// (the text `?nocutboxes` compiles — the calm frame is that build's, program for program), a SECOND set of the tracing pipelines is compiled behind the rule in the
// background once the boot is over, and the frame takes that set only while a cut box a ray can meet is alive (BoxWorld.cutTraced), going back a moment after the
// last one is gone. Both sets share every layout, bind group, buffer and history: a swap is a handful of field assignments between two frames.
//
// Who is in it: every owner of a pipeline that traces boxes — render/passes.ts (direct, restir ×2, the four gathers, both reflection kernels, the bounce cards, the
// volumetric march + its dust twin, the composite ×4 for its side ray, the traced sharp kernel), rc.ts (the cascades, every instance), froxels.ts, probe.ts (the
// light meter: ONE MODEL — guards read the cut shape's shadow too), particles.ts (the sim's collision / light rays), fogofwar.ts. The g-buffer's cut pipeline is
// its own module and always carries the rule — so the ENGINE draws a traceable cut box with it only on a frame whose ray programs carry the rule too (`drawsCut`): until
// the second set exists (the first seconds after boot), if it failed to compile, or while a dev hook pins the boot's programs, such a piece is WHOLE for the raster
// and for every GPU ray alike — never a cut shape in the picture over a box's shadow, or the reverse. (The CPU's lines — rounds, sight, sound — meet the cut shape
// from the frame the piece is born: the simulation never waits on a compile. A glass plate, picture only, is drawn cut always: no ray could disagree with it.)
