   *  maintainer's Mac it saved no time (eight pairs, −0.25 to +0.17 ms of frame, mean −0.04; the view march alone 0.08 dearer: notebook §9.7); fewer page loads is not less time where the page sits in cache.
   *  fresh = the share of the pool thin smoke may never take: as the last 2 × fresh fills, what counts as thin rises, haze is refused new bricks, keeps less air round it and gives idle bricks back sooner, so a

   *  stored as 0 there and fineRing cells of air are kept round it (these three only while fineDecay > 0); that lattice may hold fineShare of the pool, or what the coarse one leaves under softLo if that is more (haze is
