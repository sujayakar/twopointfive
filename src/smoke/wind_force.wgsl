// ---- WIND in the smoke solver (rust/game_rules/src/air/wind.rs → smoke.ts setWind → the `forces` kernel of smoke.wgsl; render/shaders/wind_field.wgsl, prepended just ahead of
// this, IS the field). One small uniform of ≤ 8 source records; WHICH of them reach a brick is a mask the solver's `link` kernel makes per brick from each source's bound. The forces
// step calls windForce(u, worldP, mask, dt) once per cell of a brick some source reaches (a whole-workgroup branch: the mask is per brick); inside a source's support the
// cell's velocity is RELAXED toward the air's — u += k·w·(v_air − u)·dt, w = |v_air| ÷ the source's face speed (1 at a
// jet's face, falling off with its own profile: cells at the fringe are barely nudged, so a plume rising BESIDE a vent keeps its own motion), k = the block's
// relax rate — after buoyancy, confinement, turbulence and the emitters, before the speed clamp and the projection. The pressure solve then does what air does
// with it: a jet blown at the floor spreads along it, a jet into a corner vents the way it can, mass is conserved. Nothing here injects density or heat, and no
// source ever makes or keeps a brick: wind only bends smoke that already exists — which is exactly what the guards' sight lines then march through.
