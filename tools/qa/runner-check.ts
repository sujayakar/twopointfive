// DROPS IT AND RUNS — the check behind src/game/runner.ts (RUNNER.on: on in the page, ?norunner; off on the frozen stand, TPS_RUNNER=1 beside TPS_MORALE=1).
// Standalone and through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/runner-check.ts          bun run tools/qa/probes.ts runner
// morale-check's staging: the compound's room clear, the guard hut's man 2.4 m behind his door in a hut with its lamps put out, the 40 mm's burst on the door —
// he is BROKEN (morale.ts), holds low on the hole; a magazine lobbed through it draws the rest of his own (the bait), and his change begins: the DRY WINDOW.
// The player is then stood in front of him. Where the rest of the garrison is differs by case. Headless, PASS / FAIL each, on sim state:
//   (1) broken, alone, dry, the player in his eyes 2.5 m off: he shouts it — spoken — BEFORE the weapon leaves his hand (no weapon item of his on the floor at
//       the shout, one `beatSecs` later), he is at least two metres from where he dropped it two seconds on, never faster than the guards' chase pace, and
//       not a round leaves his gun from the shout to the end
//   (2) two living mates left on their posts in another room: he reaches one, shouts it to them, the mates in earshot are TOLD — the room fight's noise record
//       on the post of the man he ran in on reads the place the enemy stood, stamped at the tell — he goes on out, and is taken off the floor once out with no enemy's line on him
//   (3) no mate left alive: straight out (never the mates' leg) and off the floor
//   (4) …and with him the last man up, the room clear reads 'taken' while he is still alive and running
//   (5) a teammate stood beside the player with a clear line to him as he runs: never his target, not a round — and the SAME teammate on the same line takes
//       the same man when he has not run (the control: the switch off for that run)
//   (6) shot while running: he goes down like any man, and no second weapon falls — the one item of his on the floor is the one he dropped
//   (7) broken but not dry (the player in his eyes before the bait) · dry but not alone (a mate at his shoulder) · dry, alone, the enemy in his eyes seven
//       metres off: nobody runs
//   (8) the switch off (MORALE on): nobody is taken, nothing falls, he changes his magazine — and the run draws and digests as a stand that never had the rule
//       on. A SANITY LINE ONLY, as morale-check's: 'off = the build as it was' is proven by the frozen digests of the gate's families.
//   (9) every line of the file fits a bubble, names nothing off the blocklist, no compass word, none twice
//   (10) a man of the NIGHT STAFF (the default level's own roster, started through runnerBreak): never taken off the floor, nobody's free man on his round
//        (Guard.hold + pinned: what the chat, the needs and the greetings ask), no torch — and the game's own checkpoint (savestate.ts through the harness's
//        snapshot / restore) brings his run back: fled, the same phase, the same place to tell, still held
//   (11) AFTER GONE: two and a half seconds on from the frame he left the floor, the room clear's attempt, the night breach's staging count, the player
//        object and the head count are what they were (the scenario's "my cast was taken away" test does not restart the floor) — in the room clear with
//        mates alive, with none, and in a bare night breach (the man started through runnerBreak and, fled, taken off the floor by the check's own despawnUnit:
//        that level is one roof, he has no way out of it)
//   (12) NO WAY OUT (nothing counts as outside): the corner — low, his face to the wall (away from the enemy), not a word, still fled, still on the floor;
//        held where he stands on each run at a way out, he gives up after `retries` and stays; his runs not spent and the way free, he is out
//   (13) the enemy ONE metre in front of him at the shout: he gains distance — never low at the man's feet
//   (14) GRABBED after the drop: held like any man, his light dark in Sam's arm, still fled; let go, he runs again; no second weapon ever
//   (15) an operative of the team's with NO script (the floor's own target pick, guards.ts acquireFoe) on a clear line: never his foe, not a round — and
//        the control takes the same man when he has not run
//   (16) his squad (enemysquads.ts, raised for the case) counts him out: the last man of it fled, the squad reads nobody up
// NOT STAGED: a grenade wind-up cancelled by the shout (frag.ts's wind-up is private to its book; the clause is one line beside the dead / held test).
// It raises what it needs itself (blasts take doors off, the destruction dial, both switches), so it passes on the frozen stand and under TPS_PROFILE=shipped.
// RUNNER_BREAK=1 = the FLED MARK never sticks (wiped before every frame: the run itself goes on, and every seam that asks `runnerFled` is told no) — the
// counting, the team's eyes, the empty hand, the scenario's cast test and the squad's count all answer as the build without the rule: must fail.
// exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
