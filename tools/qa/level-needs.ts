// WHAT A LEVEL NEEDS, ASKED OF A LEVEL — the checker of .claude/skills/level/SKILL.md (the list of everything a level has been seen to need, each item with
// what was missed when it was learnt). It asks what stands AROUND a level's file: the tables it is registered in, the kit its team is issued, and three
// things about its boxes that no other check holds. The floor itself (structure, nav, size, the scripted runs) is tools/qa/map-check.ts's, which --run runs.
// Read off the level FILES and the tables: no game is stood up, nothing is played.
//   bun run tools/qa/level-needs.ts [name …] [--run] [--jobs 4] [--skip need,…] [--quiet] [--md out.md] [--json out.json]
//     name      levels to ask (levels/<name>.json; a look twin `<name>-gwot.json` is asked with its plain file, never by itself); none = every level file
//     --run     also run the level's OWN checks as they stand (export --check, map-check --no-runs, level-lint, door-size, second-way-check, lived-check,
//               kitview-plan, level-names-check, floor-order-check, quiet-check, lesson-check), each a line with its exit code, `--jobs` at a time
//     --skip    needs left out (their names below): to see the exit code of the rest while one is red everywhere
//     --quiet   FAIL and NOTE lines only, and the tally
//     --md      a table, a row per level and a column per need, written to a file (the statement of how the levels stand)
//   NEEDS_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/level-needs.ts    the red path: one level is given every gap this tool can see (in memory: nothing is written) and each
//               must be found: exit 1 = every planted gap was found, 0 = one was MISSED (the line says which)
//   run it on BOTH stands (TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front): --run's own checks are the stand's. THE NEEDS THEMSELVES ARE ASKED OF THE PAGE AS IT OPENS on
//               either stand (host/profile.ts pageSwitches with no flag and the kit read with nothing kept, as the shipped stand boots): a rule the
//               frozen stand holds off would call a man bare whom no player sees bare. `KITDEAL_BREAK=1` in front shows the cards as the table
//               writes them: red on every row that brings a third man
// exit 0 = no FAIL · 1 = a FAIL (a NOTE never fails) · 2 = no such level, or an unknown need to skip
// WHAT IS ASKED (the word in front is the need's name in the table and in the skill):
//   generator   the file says which generator wrote it, and that generator is in the tree
//   mission     a row of scene/scenarioList.ts plays it (a NOTE without one: a yard, a test floor)
//   row         each row's words are there and the length the lists hold them to (place 6‥64; blurb 20‥160, a squad row's 20‥140), it names as many
//               ways in as the file gives starts, its defenders are the cap's eleven or fewer, and it says `squads` exactly when the file carries defender
//               squads; a NOTE while it is `untuned`
//   music       audio/setlist.ts has the level's two pieces (the game's own lookup, by level and by kind)
//   picture     each row's mission picture is on disk and in the stills list
//   kit picture the Team & kit picture's block is in the file (a lesson's is data only: not asked), and a look twin carries the same block to the byte
//   look        the look twin and scene/look.ts agree; a loud level with neither a twin nor the look's own kit is a NOTE (it plays in the plain look alone)
//   lived       the rooms the level names have things standing in them (lived-in things, the generator's own furniture, loose props); a NOTE names the
//               bare ones. A count, not a judgement: whether a room has a use and a face is the eye's
//   floor       a NOTE where the file has no footstep map of its own (it is walked on the office's rectangles, or a quiet level on lino throughout)
//   ground      a NOTE when 40 m² or more of ground in one piece has nothing on it: no paint that reads against its own, no rubble or kerb, within
//               1.5 m (bareGround below; the six biggest pieces, each with a square of its own; the look twin's too). Measured from the file's boxes
//               and paints: a guide for the eye, which has the last word
//   leak        a NOTE where a thing of mirror metal stands against a wall with a lamp behind it that outweighs its own room's light: a traced reflection
//               of a face that close to a wall reads the light cache through the wall, and bare metal shows it whole (leakReads below; the rooms and
//               lamps that have most of them). Every other finish is counted and passes. Where to look in a real browser: not a statement that the
//               picture shows it, and not a number a renderer's mend can move (it reads the file, not the shaders)
//   key         a NOTE for each pair of spot lights of like strength that face each other, each reaching the middle of the ground between, with
//               nothing ceiling-high on the line from one to the other: each fills the other's shadows and that ground reads as one wash
//               (facingLights below). It says when the photocell has both out at the hour the level's rows play. A pair, not a judgement
//   lamps       a NOTE for each lamp under open sky that is not in the light group `exterior` (the photocell puts those out at midday: any other burns
//               through the day, which is right only for a lamp the mission switches itself)
//   moon        one directional light, in `exterior` (the hour's sun goes in at its place)
//   doorway     no painted band or other wall decal runs across a doorway
//   roof        no DRAWN slab at ceiling height (the camera cannot see the room under it), and no more roofs than the rain reads (four)
//   kit         as issued, at every team size the row offers, every man who comes carries something besides his gun. The issue is ONE table for five men
//               (game/kit.ts), worn shared out over the men who come (KITDEAL, kitWorn), a level's own cards written over the table's first as a
//               staging does: were the table to leave a man bare this is red on every row that brings him, and the mend is that table's, not a
//               level's. Bare = no pouch filled and nothing in the big slot.
//               NOTES for what the issue is for on this floor: locked and steel doors against the door charges issued, frags issued where a frag on
//               order is refused (a hostage, a man to take), a quiet mission's partner kitted as issued for a loud one
//   response    a level has a response team only where its file says so (scenarios.response, game/qrf.ts). With the block: its `why` is a sentence, a look
//               twin carries the same block, and a row of the level is one the block answers (a NOTE if none). Without: the level is in NOBODY_COMES
//               below with its reason, or it has not answered (a NOTE). In both is a FAIL. Not asked of a lesson. The block against the built floor,
//               and a call played through, are tools/qa/response-check.ts's
//   said        docs/agents names the level (its file, its generator or a row's id) — that a write-up is THERE, not that it is good

/** LEAK: the things in a level that the light cache is read for THROUGH A WALL. The renderer keeps bounced light in a lattice of probes a metre apart
 *  (render/rc.ts, `defaultRcConfig`) and reads it, where a ray lands on a face, one probe spacing along that face's normal, blended between the four
 *  probes round that point in plan. A wall is a hand thick: a thing stood against one has faces whose read lands beside or beyond the wall, among
 *  probes that stand in the room behind it. If a lamp lights that room and not this one, the thing can glow with the other room's light (the
 *  manager's shelves against the lit store: docs/agents/render.md, 08-12 and, on a man, 10-20; the maintainer's shots of 10-23 on the shelves again).
 *  THE MEASURE, in plan, from the file alone. A WALL is cut as tools/qa/bouncewalls-check.ts cuts one (casts a shadow, from the floor to the ceiling,
 *  long and thin: a mast or a pillar is not; its numbers are typed again here, and a turned wall is kept here), and the line of a door the file does
 *  not hold open. Between a face and a probe a wall counts a hand's width short of each end, so that a line grazing its end goes round it. A LAMP is a
 *  light of the file that is not the sun or moon and not authored off, and a flat fixture authored on that game.ts stands an area light in for (a
 *  ceiling panel, a screen: its brightest channel times its face). A probe is LIT by a lamp in range with no wall between them (a spot too: its
 *  bounce fills the room its cone is in), or by the sky where no roof is over it and the file has a sun or moon; a probe inside a wall is dark. For
 *  every box a ray can land on that is not the building's own (no decal, not glass, no group of STRUCTURE), and every loose prop, a point every `step`
 *  along each side face and the top: the read point, its four probes and their shares; a probe counts for a light when a wall parts it from the face,
 *  that light lights it, and the same light does not reach the face. A thing is named when one light's counted share on any of its points is `share`
 *  or more, by the lamp before the sky. It is STRONG when that lamp's figure there (share x strength over distance squared, no unit) is `glow` or more
 *  and more than the face has of its own: the lamps that reach the face directly, a spot in its cone only. That is the manager's shelves: a lamp
 *  close behind the wall, and the room's own lamp looking elsewhere. It is a MIRROR when its finish is bare metal and smoother than the
 *  widest cut any preset traces a reflection under (`mirrorCut`: the presets' `rt.maxRough`, 0.55 on ultra, 0.45 on high, 0.35 on medium). That is the cause
 *  the renderer's owner found for the 10-23 shots: a traced reflection shades what it hits with the cache read one spacing along the HIT's normal,
 *  with no wall test, so a board's top, an upright's side or the floor within half a cell of a wall blends the cells behind it; a metal's reflection
 *  carries its whole colour and any other finish's a few hundredths, so only the steel unit glowed. The need notes the strong mirrors and counts
 *  the rest. What this is NOT: a statement that the picture shows it, or a number a
 *  renderer's mend can move. Which reads the renderer already bounds (the gather's bounce by the plane the ray left, a man's by the nearest box), a
 *  lamp the game switches later, heights (a plan: a wall under the ceiling is no wall), a thing of another finish that a mirror beside it reflects, the
 *  metal of the building's own groups (a window's or a door's frame), a steel door leaf (`doors` carry no finish here), a loose prop's finish and how
 *  bright the sky is (a read by the sky is never strong: counted apart) are not in it. */
