// GUNS, TRUNKS AND HEADS THAT SNAP — a watcher over whole scripted play-throughs (playthrough.ts's own runs, each in a fresh process as the tallies run them) and
// the probes that hold what it finds. The maintainer, 10-08: "the AI look crisp when clearing rooms, but i wonder if they're rotating too quickly. needs to
// feel realistic and reflect weapon weight". A SWING here = a net turn of MIN degrees or more inside WIN seconds (60° inside a tenth by default: a gun, a chest
// or a face that is somewhere else the next time you look) — its size the LARGEST net turn any span of it up to WIN long holds — read every frame after each armed man's own
// update:
//   gun     Character.gunYaw — where the MODEL has his gun: what the fire gates read (the turn weight's own yaw; a round leaves the DRAWN muzzle)
//   rifle   the yaw of Character.gunDir — the bore AS DRAWN (a long gun's is the hands' own line; the weapon light rides it), read only while it is within 60° of
//           level (muzzle up at port arms it has no heading). A carriage change throws this one where the model's yaw does not move
//   trunk   the SHOULDER LINE as posed (upper arm joint to upper arm joint, in the world) — what the camera over him sees of his chest: the aim's twist, the
//           long gun's carriage and every layer included; a hunch or a lean does not move it (the chest's own facing, 30‥45° nose down over a rifle, does)
//   head    the head's own left-right line as posed (Character.headRot) — the neck's lead and the gaze layer included; a nod does not move it
//   body    Character.bodyYaw — his feet (reported beside each swing, never a verdict by itself)
// A row is dropped, and the window with it, across a staging (moved more than character.ts TURN.jump in a frame), a ragdoll, a gap in his clock.

//                                            (shouldered ↔ low ready) while the gun is swinging. The animator's to fix, and the fight reads those bones: a fix

// the trunk and the head are read off.) THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: this reads the pose the page would draw, not a picture of it.
