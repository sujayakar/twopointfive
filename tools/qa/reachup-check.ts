// 'reachup' — CROUCHED BEHIND A STANDING MAN, THE GRAB'S REACH GOES UP FOR HIS NECK (CLOSE.reachUp → anim.readyUp, character.ts READY_UP). The maintainer, off
// the stealth tutorial mission with a still of Sam crouched behind a sentry: "the closer than ever animations are still a bit wonky". The tell's free hand is
// measured off Sam's own shoulder, which at the crouch is level with the man's belt: the open hand went to the small of his back and Sam's face to his seat.
//   bun run tools/qa/reachup-check.ts        (also `probes.ts reachup`; run it on BOTH stands: TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the second)
//   up        crouched and stopped behind a standing man at three gaps, the key up against the key down: the left hand is over 1.05 m off the floor (it was
//             under 0.95), his head is higher, the hand is not inside the man, and the crouch the game reads has not moved.
//   stand     on his feet behind the same man: the pose is the same to the bit with the key up or down (the point is not over him); and crouched with the
//             pistol up ('grabGun': the gun keeps its aim) the same to the bit too.
//   ease      crouched: in to reach, a second there, back out — the left wrist's largest one-frame move (off his own root) with the key up is no more than a quarter over what it is with the key down.
//   harness   the key is a row of the two stands' list with its word, off on the frozen stand and on in the page (`?noreachup` puts it off), rides a
//             recording's tables, and a recording from before the key replays with it off.
// REACHUP_BREAK=1 = the key left down where `up` asks for it up: up must FAIL.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: nothing here is a picture (tools/qa/close-stills.ts + pose-mesh-raster.py draw the same staging on the worn mesh).
