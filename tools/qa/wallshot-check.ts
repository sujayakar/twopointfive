// came up still blind inside the pall and shot the first man through the hole 2.7 s after the blast.

// each on a fresh stand with its room clear dealt for four. Headless: the smoke solver is a null object here, so the pall is read as what the game ASKS of it
// (every emitter handed to g.smoke.emit); what the cloud then hides is the page's to say.
