// The 'doorpath' family: EACH MAN OF A ROOM ENTRY WALKS A REAL PATH THROUGH THE DOOR (src/game/doorpath.ts DOORPATH; on in the page — ?nodoorpath is the entry as it was —, TPS_DOORPATH=1 in the harness).
// The checks are made on whole seeded playthroughs (tools/qa/playthrough.ts — the scripted commander, the real door orders, the real fight), each watched by
// tools/qa/paths-watch.ts on every frame of every room entry:
//   doorpath-paths   with the switch ON, over the seeded runs below: no man of an entry in a door leaf (and no leaf swept through one), none through a
//                    friend, no two on one spot (centres under 0.45 m for over 0.3 s), none in a jamb or any other static — and the walk was really used (men sent on it, most of them walked it out)
//   doorpath-gun     with the switch ON AND ITS GUN RULE ON (TPS_DOORPATH=1,gun=1 — the rule ships off: doorpath.ts says why): no man of an entry carries his rifle, or shines his weapon light, through a door leaf — each its own line. A spell
//                    of `GUN_SECS` or longer fails; a shorter brush (a muzzle swung past a leaf's edge) is listed, not failed
//   doorpath-file    with the switch ON: the men cross the frame line one at a time in the order dealt (nobody crosses while a man dealt ahead of him is
//                    still outside; nobody is dealt ahead of a man who stood well nearer the frame AT HIS OWN JAMB), no two nearer than a body apart
//                    as they cross, and nobody is kept waiting past the cap. The order dealt is the entry's own queue, kept by the watcher from the
//                    frame it is dealt; until 10-13 it was guessed from who stood nearer the frame at the go, whichever jamb he stood at — which a
//                    stack split unevenly round a door breaks by the deal alone (the rebuilt barracks' s1: the two sides go in turn about, the far
//                    side's man stands 0.86 m further off and is dealt second). That crossing is listed, not failed. ITS RED PATH:
//                    `DOORPATH_FILE_BREAK=1` preloads tools/qa/doorpath-backward.ts (the walk lets each entry go back to front) and must FAIL on
//                    the order line, with a "red path" line that must PASS
//   doorpath-off     with the switch OFF nothing of the walk is in the run: each run ends the same way and digests the same as the same run with
//                    tools/qa/doorpath-inert.ts preloaded in front of it (every method of the walk throwing but its three per-frame entries, which
//                    are emptied; every knob but `on` set to nonsense), and each of the runs sends men through a door — three runs on the harness's
//                    frozen stand and three on the stand the page ships (TPS_PROFILE=shipped), the walk pinned off on both; all of DOORPATH_RUNS
//                    with DOORPATH_ALL=1. THE TREE IS COMPARED WITH ITSELF, so play moving on for any other reason never turns it red (it read
//                    frozen digests until 10-13: ordinary merges after the last freeze had moved them, at least six times, and it had been red
//                    for two days with the walk not in it). ITS RED PATHS, each must FAIL: `DOORPATH_OFF_BREAK=1` the walk on in both runs (the
//                    preloaded one dies on its first frame) · `=2` the walk switched on behind the pin in the preloaded run alone (the two runs
//                    end, and digest apart) · `=3` the walk on in both and only the knobs set to nonsense in the second (the nonsense is read) — and each
//                    says, in a "red path" line that must PASS, that it went red for that reason and not for a preload that fell over.
//                    WHAT IT DOES NOT SHOW: that off = the build before the module (taken once, 48 runs of 48 against 4b510dd, when the walk went
//                    in), nor an edit to the entry's own switched-off branch (doortools.ts, the `: t < q.at` arm of the queue) — that changes both
//                    runs alike and is the door tools' checks to catch. A recorded digest would show both, and is what went stale
// THE FAMILY'S OWN RED PATH: `DOORPATH_OLD=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts doorpath-paths` (and `… doorpath-gun`) runs the same check on the entry AS IT WAS (the
// switch off) and must FAIL — on the build this was written against a door leaf goes through a man of the entry in every one of these runs, and a rifle and
// its light through the server room's leaf in the first (room-clear-four seed 1, 22 s: the still the cast goal's clip caught). doorpath-file and doorpath-off
// have red paths of their own (DOORPATH_FILE_BREAK, DOORPATH_OFF_BREAK: above).
// `PT_NOCLOSER=1` in front of any of them: no door shuts itself — the leaves an entry meets once doors stay open.
