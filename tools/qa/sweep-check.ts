//

//   TPS_PROFILE=shipped bun run tools/qa/sweep-check.ts                     (the page's stand — it holds on both)
//
// THE SWITCH IS THE CHECK'S OWN, so that it asks the same thing on both stands: the frozen stand holds HARD.sweep off (TPS_SWEEP=1 raises it), the page
// raises it. Each arm writes HARD.sweep itself — before the difficulty is set, and again once the game stands (standUp puts the stand's own word over it)
// — and puts it back after.
// One staging per level, played three times (hard with the row on · hard with the row off · standard with the row on), same seed: the scenario is
// started as its row starts it, the team is never given an order and stands where the mission put it, ONE loud report is filed where Sam stands (the
// word: a loud thing in a man's ears), and then nothing — the game is stepped with Sam unlit and nobody of the team moving. Lines:
//   room-clear-four (no squads, goLook)
//     hard            a look is called on the net, never before the word is `sweepSecs` old; `sweepMen` are let go `sweepBeat` after the call; both leave
//                     where they stood and close on the report. (WHEN it comes: on hard that report is stood to — PRESSURE.warned — and no look is
//                     called while a report stands, so it is `reportSecs + standSecs` after the report here, not `sweepSecs`. The line does not pin that.)
//     hard, row off   no look called, no man let go
//     standard        the same nothing
//   mousehole-four (squads, all `mayLeave: false` — `sweepStayers` lets one send its look; lookOut)
//     hard            one squad says so once on its net, not before the word is `sweepSecs` old, files one 'sweep' event `SQUADS.sweepBeat` after the
//                     line, and two of its men are let go then and leave where they stood
//     hard, row off   no line, no 'sweep' event, no man let go, no squad with men out
//     standard        the same nothing
// The team stands where the report was, so a look that gets there finds it: what happens to the pair after it is let go is printed, not judged.
// SWEEP_BREAK=1 = the 'hard' arm played with HARD.sweep left off: the hard lines must FAIL (exit 1).
// FLANKCALL_BREAK=1 = the dialogue pass taken off under each arm: where the stand has it on (shipped, or TPS_WORDS=1) the flanker's-call line must FAIL.
// Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a FAIL or an error. About a minute. Headless only: what a look reads like on the page (the line on the net, two men walking a
// corridor) has never been seen on a GPU by this check.
