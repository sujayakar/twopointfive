// 'close' — closer than ever (src/game/close.ts; hooked into player.ts buildInteractables / startTakedown / startGrab, game.ts's click site and seat tick, guards.ts sightGain,
// character.ts creep / ready):   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts close | close-<name> [--verbose]     (`bun run tools/qa/close-probes.ts` runs the family alone: exit 0 / 1)
// The ask the family holds line by line: "the animation changes when you enter the mode, the character changes when you're close enough to do a melee attack … melee attacks
// work from all angles, grabbing only works from behind, and then the sneaking animation is designed so it can be paused frame by frame in this mode (pausing movement sticks
// in the current position, not reverting back to an idle state)" · "sam doesn't pull out his knife when he's within melee radius, just reaches for it" · "lethal vs. nonlethal
// melee kills like splinter cell".
// All headless, on the lobby's open floor (nothing within 2 m at shin, chest or head height — checked by ray at every staging), against the office's south outer wall from the
// strip outside it, and in the break room with its lights off. Every probe raises CLOSE.on itself (the frozen stand holds it off) and puts the whole table back as it found it.
//   close-mode        THE MODE: on by distance at 30° steps round a standing man (off at 3.1 m coming in, on at 2.9, still on at 3.5 going out, off at 3.7); off through a wall;
//                     off for every suppressing state (a show, down, a man in the arm, a body in tow, the kick, the lock, the rifle up, sprinting, the wall) and with
//                     CLOSE.mode off; anim.creep is the mode on the same tick, creepAt his chest; the nearer of two men
//   close-tell        THE TELL: at 30° steps at 0.8 m, hands empty — anim.ready 'grab' in the rear arc, 'strike' everywhere else, never null; the hand on the hilt
//                     (anim.reachShown ≥ 0.9 within 0.5 s, under 0.1 within 0.6 s of stepping out) and the knife NEVER out (anim.knifeShown false throughout); the pistol up:
//                     'grabGun' behind, nothing elsewhere, no reach; behind a chair: 'seat'; CLOSE.ready off: nothing
//   close-melee       MELEE FROM EVERY ANGLE, THE PLAYER'S CHOICE: at 30° steps through the real click — LEFT = the knife (dead: 'shot', not breathing, kills +1, a 'kill' row
//                     "killed — the knife", blows.knife +1, takedown.lethal) · RIGHT = the knockout ('struck', breathing, knockouts +1, a 'ko' row, blows.knockout +1); the
//                     fall's hearing level by the way in, Sam never through him and no further than his station; the knife drawn only inside the lethal blow; an ALERT man
//                     facing Sam (alertStrike on; refused with it off); CLOSE.lethal off; under a show; a civilian (never a kill); the pistol up (no blow)
//   close-grab        GRABBING ONLY FROM BEHIND: at 30° steps (and each side of the arc's edge) the grab row and Space — a hold starts only in the rear arc, elsewhere no row and
//                     nothing starts; from straight behind 'held' on the same frame as with the switch off; a seated man: hauled out from the rear arc at 1.15 m, never from his front
//   close-held        THE HELD SNEAK: Sam crouched on a puppet goal past a man, stopped four times in one walk — from the frame his root is at rest the phase does not move
//                     (1e-6) and feet / toes / hands stay within 2 cm for 80 frames; each stop stands in the stride it stopped in (the four differ), where with CLOSE.mode
//                     off the four stops all end in the idle's one stance; on resuming the phase goes on from the held value, no frame's step above the walk's own
//   close-dark        THE DARK: closeNearK's table (the light on Sam × patrol / search / alert × 0.5 / 1.0 m; the switches) and guards.ts sightGain under it; played in the break
//                     room, visibility fed from the CPU light estimate as the game's meter would — across a man's front at 1.2 m (his torch out): unnoticed in the dark with
//                     the rule, noticed without it, noticed either way with the room lit; through his burning torch: noticed (the light term is the build's); past his side
//                     with the torch burning; and the exhibit — three men, torches burning, Sam threading between them
//   close-windows     the table: a standing staff man's 1440 bearings each in EXACTLY one window (by the interface's own cosine AND by closeAt), 'behind' = the set
//                     cos(b) < −0.25 to the float and the only window that grabs, left / right mirror images; side off → the front takes their arc; front off → that arc
//                     gives nothing; a seated man = the same rear arc with the seat's reach + ONE front strike window; a civilian = one rear window
//   close-offer       closeAt from staged spots: 180° / 120° / ±77° / 30° / 0° at 0.7 m and 1.5 m — kind, inReach, grab, strike, can, why; sprinting; an alert man
//                     (strike only; nothing with alertStrike off); a wall between
//   close-rows        the rows a real frame builds: behind / a side / the front / the pistol drawn / CLOSE.lethal off — wording, the marker's `close` — and the build's own
//                     row with the switch off
//   close-marks       closeMarks (ships OFF: the probe turns CLOSE.marks on and says so): four windows in the open, 'in' with its words in the one Sam stands in; THE
//                     PRECISION CLAIM — a 4 cm grid round the man, 'drawn' against 'offered', in the open and against a wall; no vertex past the wall's face
//   close-seat        closeSeat: down inside a second and a half, the sitting clip, kept on his mark; up the frame he is anything but calm; refusals; both buttons and
//                     Space on a seated man from beyond the standing reach; a restart leaves nobody seated
//   close-harness     the frozen stand holds CLOSE.on off, the page's boot turns it on unless ?noclose, the table is a registered knob table a recording carries
//   close-off         switch OFF: nothing told at any bearing (ready / creep / reach / knife), the build's own rows, closeMode null, closeNearK exactly 1, closeMarks empty,
//                     CLOSE_STATS untouched by a takedown, a grab and two 20 s runs; a seeded walk-up + grab and a 20 s walk to and fro past a man each digest the same twice
//                     and the same again with close.ts's read-only functions called every frame
//   close-duo         the two-person game (pairup.ts PAIRUP.on, one partner, silent, 'fall in' — the pair family's own stand, pairup-probes.ts `rig`) with CLOSE.on: the
//                     partner is never a subject of any of it; on a defender the mode, the tell, both buttons from behind / a side / the front, Space from behind
//                     only and the held gait; the partner's 'take him · on your mark' afterwards against the switch off; the order menu keeps the right button;
//                     the dark rule is Sam's alone (a partner in a defender's near field is seen as ever) + what the partner does when Sam crosses the dark, as observed
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU AND NO DOM: the picture (the sheathed knife, the stance as drawn, the floor marks) is not measured here — what is measured is what close.ts tells the
// animator, what the animator reports back (creepShown / reachShown / knifeShown, the bones), and the game's own books.
