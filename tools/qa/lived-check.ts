// LIVED-IN ROOMS' CHECK (src/scene/lived.ts) — `bun run tools/qa/lived-check.ts [levels/x.json | x …] [--sheet] [--base <rev> | --base none] [--quiet]`
// The furniture that makes a room its own place is REAL (it blocks feet, rounds and sight), so it can break a level the way paint cannot. Per level file:
//   1. OFF IS THE LEVEL AS IT WAS: the file with its lived things taken out (boxes in group 'lived' / 'lived.<room>', props / lights / switchables whose id
//      starts 'lived.') equals the file at <rev> key for key, and loads to the same Level with the switch off (default rev = THE LEVEL'S OWN BASE, its row
//      in LEVEL_BASE below, the last step that changed that level's own part on purpose; a level with no row: BASE_REVS; `--base <rev>` holds every level
//      named to that one; `--base none` once no rev speaks for the level; a level its rev does not have is not asked). A lesson's WORDS and LISTS are read
//      from today's file (LESSON_FREE below says which keys, and why those);
//   2. EVERY AUTHORED POINT STILL STANDS: each floor point the level's scenarios, routes, plans, mission, chokepoints, civilians and marks name (team starts,
//      defenders' marks, pods, waypoints, deals, lesson spots) is free in the nav grid if it was, and no lived solid or prop is within a body's width of it;
//   3. NOBODY'S AIM IS WALLED: a mark's `pos` → `aimAt` line that was open is still open;
//   4. DOORS KEEP THEIR FLOOR: no lived solid or prop within 1.1 m of a door's hinge-to-latch line with a line to it from either face (the leaf's sweep, the
//      jambs a stack stands on);
//   5. THE FLOOR IS STILL ONE FLOOR: every cell a man could walk to from the spawn he still can (a cut-off pocket of 3 cells or more fails, a smaller one
//      warns), and the walk between any two authored points is no more than 30 % + 1.5 m longer;
//   6. BUDGET: boxes ≤ 900 a level (a warning past it), lights ≤ 64.
// `--sheet` prints, per `lived.<room>` group, what the room got (solids, drawn-only clutter, floor pieces, props, lights, paints) and which of the level's
// own named rooms got nothing. Lines are `- PASS — …` / `- FAIL — …` (tools/qa/gate.sh counts them); exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a check failed, 2 = bad usage.
// With no file named: every level that carries a lived thing or has a row of its own in LEVEL_BASE (none = NO VERDICT, exit 0).
// THE CHECK'S OWN BREAK PATH (in memory, no file is written): `LIVED_BREAK=1` moves each level's first own box half a metre and stands its first lived solid in
// its first door — the damage furniture work can do — and must be red on line 1 and on the doors' line of every level; `LIVED_BREAK=lesson` changes every HELD
// key of each lesson's first marked step and of its frame (LESSON_HELD) and must be red on every level with a lesson; `LIVED_BREAK=lists` adds a word to every
// step's `allow` and to the frame's `allow`, `orders` and `rows` and nothing else, and must be red on every level with a lesson; `LIVED_BREAK=words` changes EVERY key
// of the LESSON_FREE table on every step, the lesson and its frame, and must stay green: what a lesson's owner may change with no new base is that table.

// The base = the last step that changed a level's own part (everything but its lived things) ON PURPOSE: newest first, and the one this checkout's HEAD descends
// from is taken, else the newest (the last entry: the commit that brought the work to this repo, where every level stood as the bases before it had left it. Those
// older bases are commits of the history before the move and are not in a clone of this repo, so they are no longer listed; the last of them was the records office's Team & kit door picture, scenarios.kitView — the LAST picture to take one: the block is exempt below; before it the police post's terminal on the bunk room's footlocker; before it the floodlit shed's roof flagged to be seen through from above; before it real-size doors, then the look levels' floor decals re-layered, then every level's floor laid in tiers, then a door hung outward or a window for every room a wedge could shut) — so the check holds on a branch from before a step and on the join after it.
// A base may itself carry lived things: its lived things are taken out like today's, and what is held is everything else.
// 6b2c35201: the crossing's east wall foot cut at the yard gate's frame (one box more; no other level's own part moved).
// fcae91f17: the snatch's footstep plan covers the whole world, so the gate hut's zone is read.
// 9fb5b67a1: the join of those two steps. The check holds EVERY level against ONE base, and each of the two holds only its own level's change, so the base
// is the first commit that carries both; a later step that changes a level's own part on purpose goes in front of it the same way (UNTIL 10-22: see CLOSED, below).
// 150575169: the glasshouse's back wall foot cut at the back door's frame (the same: one box more, no other level's own part moved).
// 113556864: the join that first carries the glasshouse's step with the two before it (one base for every level, as above).
// 105ddc056: the join that carries the long hall's two files without the ballistic shield (its issue block is empty; no other level's own part moved).
// f48b54d8d: the door names (scenarios.doorNames in 25 files: words a row reads, no box, door, mark or route moved).
// 14d5fc1f4: exits, areas and 23 doors renamed in 22 files (names only: scenarios.quiet starts / exits / wayouts, places.areas, doorNames; nothing else moved).
// 98281d690: the snatch's van and its response block (levels/snatch.json alone). 317a19cb1: the join of the two, the first here that holds both.
// 5f8c416e6: the tutorial's squad mission, a level no base before it has. It is the base for EVERY level, as each of these is (one base for all): every
//   level's 429 lines were green against it when it went in, and tut-squad's lived things are held to their tail from here.
// cb936797b: the join that first carries the ledger's own level (levels/tut-quiet.json rebuilt whole; no other level's own part moved).
// 0d3a18078: the ledger's lines and cards reworded and the rows Space offers there (words and a list in levels/tut-quiet.json alone; no box, door, mark or route moved).
// c069ca16f: a join's base. The two before it are siblings (one took the fog of war out of levels/tut-sky.json, the other reworded levels/tut-quiet.json and
//   lengthened its rows list), so neither holds both; this join is the first commit that does. No level's own part moved in the join itself.
// d13650f85: the plan mission's barrier post moved and two drums put in a corner (levels/tut-plan.json alone; a sibling of the join above).
// 3046a115e: a join's base again. c069ca16f and d13650f85 are siblings (the first holds the reworded levels/tut-quiet.json and not the plan mission's moved
//   post, the second the other way round); this join is the first commit that holds both. No level's own part moved in the join itself.
// 636e5eaef: a join's base once more. Its two parents are siblings: one glazed the hall's street window in levels/tut-squad.json (a box), reworded a card
//   there and gave a step a cue; the other is 3046a115e's line. This join is the first commit that holds both. No level's own part moved in the join itself.
// THIS LIST IS CLOSED (10-22): nothing more goes in front of it. One base for all meant that a level changed on purpose moved EVERY level's bar, and that two
// levels changed side by side on two branches left two newest bases that are siblings: on their join the one taken does not carry the other's change, and
// that level was red whatever the order. It is the base of every level with no row of its own below, and only that. (It is still a list, read newest first,
// because branches cut before the rows came still put a commit in front of it, and those lines must join without a hand; once they have it is one commit.)
