// THE DOOR WALK LETTING AN ENTRY GO BACK TO FRONT — preloaded in front of the watched runs by doorpath-probes.ts `doorpath-file` under
// DOORPATH_FILE_BREAK=1 (bun run --preload), never imported. The walk lets only the HEAD of an entry's queue go (doorpath.ts mayGo: i === 0), once the
// man before him has made room. Here only the TAIL may go, by that same room rule: the men are dealt in one order and let go in the other, and
// doorpath-file must read them as crossing out of turn. This makes doorpath.ts the first game module the process evaluates: safe while it imports
// nothing but types (the off side's probe, which checked that, went with the off side on 2026-11-06).
