// A DOOR STACK KEEPS EVERY MAN INSIDE A ROOM (src/game/stackroom.ts) — the check. the maintainer, 10-10: "the guy on the left navigated to the *outside* and was
// pushing on the wall to try to get in … stacking on a door should always put everyone within a room. or maybe an adjacent one on the other side of the door
// if the room is too small".
//
//   bun run tools/qa/stackroom-check.ts [id …] [--walk | --walk-off] [--verbose]      (no id: every level a squad plays, one after another; exit 1 on a failure;
//                                                                                    --walk-off: the walks played with the switch off — the build as it was)
//
// Per level (every row of the missions' tables with a squad, and the four other-look files), per door, per face, with 1‥N men, Sam where the row starts him,
// then on the latch jamb, then on the hinge jamb — and, in a squad of four, each pair with the other holding the door:
//   MARKS   every mark of 'stack up' (orders.ts stackPosts), of the door tools' stack (doortools.ts stackPosts, and dealStack with its step-backs) and of a
//           charge's stand-off is judged by the NAV GRID'S OWN WALK from the floor before the face — not by stackroom.ts's flood: the mark's cell is floor, the
//           walk ends ON the mark (a point beyond a wall ends on the wall's far side), it goes through NO doorway, and it is no way round a wall. One
//           doorway is allowed, for the rule's 'room next door': a door other than the ordered one, into a room the team holds, the mark by that doorway.
//   HELD    all of it again with every room of the level held by the team, so the rule's 'room next door' is open to it wherever a room is too small.
//           The same judge reads where each man is SENT by 'bang and clear', 'clear from outside' and 'open and clear' the moment they are given (the
//           door tools file the men again behind the man who opens).
//   SAM     … and with Sam stood ON each place the rule dealt when he was away (the spare floor of a narrow passage). An order the build gave is never
//           refused by the rule: that is a failure.
//   OFF     the same judged with STACKROOM.on off: the build as it was (its count is the size of the flaw).
//   --dump F  no judging: every set of marks with the rule off, a line each, appended to F. Run in this checkout and in one of the build before the rule (copy
//           this file there: it runs without stackroom.ts) — the two files must be the same, byte for byte: the off switch IS the build as it was.
//   WALK    (--walk) the furniture put home, the men put on the face's floor, Sam on a jamb, the order given, 14 s played: every man is ON his mark, and none went through a doorway on
//           the way. A man the order gave up on within a stride of a mark he had open floor to is a note and a count, not a failure: the mark is good. The records office first, as he played it: the pair from the yard, Sam on the hall door's latch jamb.
