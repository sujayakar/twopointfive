// A MAN'S BREATH IS REAL STEAM: GAS IN THE SMOKE SOLVER, NOT SPRITES — the check behind SNOW_LOOK.steam (src/game/weatherKinds.ts; the numbers
// src/game/snowBreath.ts BREATHSTEAM; on in the page, ?breathsteam=0 = the puffs; off in the module and on the frozen stand, TPS_BREATHSTEAM=1).
//
// The maintainer, 10-20: "is breath proper volumetrics or some particle effects? … seems like it'd be cool if proper", then "actually the smoke from the gun
// muzzle is fine so maybe breath should just work like that".
//
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts breathsteam      (families `snow`, `weather`)      BREATHSTEAM_BREAK=1 = the switch never raised and the same lines asked: must FAIL
//   Run it on BOTH stands (TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the page's).
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SAY. No GPU: the solver, its light and its shadows are the page's. What is read here is what the game HANDS the solver — a recording
// stand-in that says it is drawing, as tools/qa/snowbreath-check.ts reads the puffs off a recording stand-in for the particle pool — and what the game's own
// reads of smoke make of it. How the steam looks, how long it hangs and what a frame of it costs is nobody's to say from here.
//   steam     the pass's room clear, a squad of four: every living man under the open sky hands the solver one source a breath — on the fine lattice, at his
//             mouth, look-only — and files no puff
//   late      a man who was under a roof (or in the fog) as his breath began and steps out in the middle of it still steams: one source for what is left
//   follows   a source rides the mouth and takes its velocity from where the head faces and how he walks, turn by turn; it lets go of a man who dies, lies down
//             or goes into the fog, and when the switch goes off
//   sprint    the sprint rule holds on it: a man held at a run breathes more often, wider, denser and thrown harder — more so with the hard breath rule on than
//             off — and at rest the rule changes nothing
//   who       none off a dead man, a man lying down, a man the fog of war hides or a man under a roof
//   falls     with no solver drawing (the harness's null one, one that says it is not), with the steam's density at nothing, or past `reach` from where the
//             view looks, the breath is the puffs it was, record for record; with the switch off not one source
//   unread    the game's own smoke takes nothing of a breath; the solver's own code (smoke.ts, its CPU half run here on a bare object) counts none against
//             `budget`, cuts breaths before anything else when a step is over-full, takes a breath's velocity from its track, keeps a fine-only shove off the
//             coarse lattice, and says it is not drawing when switched off, frozen or not rendered
//   digest    the game does not know: 300 frames of the pass STEPPED BY THE GAME with a solver that takes the sources, on and off — one game digest; the same
//             with the senses on the CPU, where the game's own smoke ends the run holding nothing
//   whose     what remembers how a breath was shown (steam or puffs, whose source rides whose mouth, the records filed) is on the host, in no snapshot: two
//             games that differ only in whether a solver draws, where the view looks and whether a particle pool takes the puffs have one state hash; a snapshot put
//             back (with the host's hook, and without) and a restart each leave every breath with its source
//   pool      a game with a particle pool and one with none part in no row of the breath's, nor of the wind's (its list for the pool is the host's too)
//   switch    a recording carries the key, one from before it replays with it off, the frozen stand holds it off by name
