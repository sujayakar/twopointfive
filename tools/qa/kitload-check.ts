//                   taking any one thing off a card never lowers a score; a fitting or a colour weighs nothing; with the pouches rule off nobody is weighed
//   kitload-you     the plain night with your card on you (kit.ts kitSolo), W held: a light card's top walk and sprint are quicker than the issued card's
//                   and a heavy card's slower; the first footfall is quieter light and louder heavy; a guard's eye builds its notice of you more slowly
//                   light and faster heavy, and the point-blank floor is the same for all three
//   kitload-mates   the room clear staged with four: the light man's legs get more than the heavy man's and never more than `paceTop`; teamPace is still a
//                   cap that may be asked twice, and a path walked at 2.0 m/s tops out at 2.0 × his factor (once, not twice); a step's gait is read off
//                   the pace he was asked for; he is noticed more slowly; a defender (no card on him) is as he was
//   kitload-off     the same seeded walk digests the same with the switch off whatever the card; with it on, an issued card digests as the switch off
//                   (the reference plays as it did) and a light card does not
//   kitload-card    the real card on a fake DOM: two bars, the issued card's grey to their notch, the highlighted row's share outlined past the bar's end
//                   (dashed: what one more would take, on a row that carries none), a lighter card's gain and a heavier one's loss; nothing shown with
//                   the switch off; no digit anywhere on the bars
//   kitload-save    a checkpoint holds the two scores while the switch is on, and a file that says nothing leaves what the staging puts on him
// KITLOAD_BREAK=1 = the floor ignores the scores with the switch on: kitload-you, kitload-mates and kitload-off must each fail (the table and the card
// hold either way: they read no floor).
// exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: a pace is a number, a footfall an event's level, a bar a width on a fake element. Nobody has seen or played any of this.
