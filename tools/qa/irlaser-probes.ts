// The 'irlaser' family: THE TEAM'S LASERS ARE INFRARED BEHIND GOGGLES (the maintainer, 10-06: "and then we could also model IR lasers (assuming enemies don't
// have night vision)" · "ready or not is a good base case here"). The rule is game/irlaser.ts; this family is its check. Run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts irlaser | ir-draw | ir-sam | ir-unseen | ir-off
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts stood up on each scenario's own level, started as a click on its row starts it — bang-tally.ts
// stage()). What is asked is WHICH BOXES the lasers' draw hands the renderer and whether anything in the game goes differently for them. Nothing is drawn: how
// an infrared line LOOKS through the tube is not judged here, and the GPU's light meter is not run (headless it is the CPU stand-in) — what is held instead is
// the mechanism the meter rests on: a laser is boxes flagged NoShadow (in no ray's grid) and never a light (the light list is hashed frame for frame).
//   ir-draw    A TEAMMATE'S LASER FOLLOWS HIS GOGGLES, AND THE PICTURE'S: every scenario, every teammate, his laser laid eight ways.
//                · goggles down: not one box for a bare-eyed picture; for the tube's, the line and dot the red laser had — same place, same size, to the
//                  field — in the infrared tint, every box NoShadow;
//                · the line between the two pictures is the shader's (Player.nvAmount past 0.5), not the N key;
//                · goggles up (a lit place, or behind his white light): the red laser of the build before, field for field, in either picture;
//                · through Game.update, a lit walk: every man's band is his own goggles' every frame, both bands seen, and what his draw gives a bare-eyed
//                  picture is nothing when down and the red line when up;
//                · WHEN IT IS ON: Sam's goggles down and the team standing easy, every frame's boxes hold a goggled man's infrared line on his bore exactly
//                  while his gun is at his shoulder (never with the muzzle lowered for a colleague); IR.carry off: none (nobody is hunting);
//                · an enemy handed his laser back (LASER.enemy) is never infrared, whoever looks.
//   ir-sam     SAM'S OWN: a scenario's team on the floor and the gun in his hands — a line and a dot on his bore in the infrared with his goggles down, in step
//              with the picture's swap to the tube frame for frame, both ways; nothing with goggles up, holstered, sprinting, down, with IR.sam or IR.on off,
//              or in a game with no team (the office at night, alone).
//   ir-unseen  NOBODY READS ONE. Every scenario played through a held door from the same seed five times: Sam's goggles down with IR on (infrared lines in
//              the frames' boxes), with IR off (none), on again (the control); Sam's goggles up with IR on (a goggled man's laser in NO frame's boxes) and
//              off. Hashed every frame: the whole game's digest, every man's awareness and light, every camera's integrator, the light list. On ≡ off both
//              ways — no enemy's awareness and no light is any different for an infrared laser or for none — while the counts say it is not vacuous
//              (frames an infrared beam lay ON a living enemy). In these plays Sam is the sandbox's invisible man and no camera has him, so then, closely:
//              Sam plainly lit and visible, his goggles down, 3.5 m in front of an enemy with his laser on (the enemy's awareness RISES — identically with
//              the laser on, off and on again). CAMERAS do not run while a scenario's machine has the floor (devices.ts sensing), and only a scenario
//              has a team: with a team, Sam lit in a lens fills nothing, laser or not; alone in the office the lens fills and no laser exists — no laser
//              and a running camera ever share a frame today (if that changes: a lens reads Sam's meter, never a box). What no scenario has is a RED teammate laser to compare (a scenario's teammate never shows one): the red line's own
//              invisibility to every reader is the same mechanism (NoShadow boxes, no light) and is held by ir-draw's 'every box NoShadow'.
//   ir-off     THE SWITCH: IR.on false is the build before — every teammate's laser the old red draw field for field whatever his goggles and the picture
//              do, Sam with none; flipped in play it takes hold inside a frame; the Team feel rows are kept by teamfeel.ts. (The frame-for-frame identity
//              against the merged base is `bun run tools/qa/irlaser-probes.ts digest`: one hash per scenario of a scripted minute with the switch off, the
//              frames' boxes included; the same file copied into a checkout of the base must print the same lines.)
// The family's own red path: IR_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ir-draw must FAIL (a bare-eyed picture told it is the tube's).
