// The 'moves' family: THE LOUD DEMO'S MOTION PASS (src/game/character.ts MOVES / MV) — a rifle that recoils, the bang tossed off the support hand, the stun
// charge's hunch, the flinch and the hit as two different things, the two sides' gaits, the stack's squeeze. The harness stands the game up with the pass OFF
// (host/standup.ts) so every older probe and frozen digest measures the animator as it was; this family turns it on.
//
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts moves | moves-off | moves-recoil | moves-react | moves-toss | moves-dazzle | moves-gait | moves-game | moves-reload | moves-kept | moves-entry | moves-second | moves-hands | moves-snap
//
//   moves-off     · with the pass off the new calls ARE the old ones: flinchFrom / hitFrom = hit(), tossItem = signal('go'), signal('squeeze') = signal('hold') — the pose bit for bit
//   moves-recoil  · four rounds: the gun comes back and climbs, more for an untrained man than a trained one, both hands stay on it, and it settles back
//   moves-react   · the flinch and the hit: feet where they stood, hands on the gun, the head down in a flinch, the trunk knocked along the round in a hit, back at rest after
//   moves-toss    · the support hand leaves the gun, swings through and is back on it; the trigger hand keeps the rifle; feet where they stood
//   moves-dazzle  · blinded: head down and turned off the charge, the forearm up at the face, held as long as the game holds him; eased back out after
//   moves-gait    · the trained walk sits lower and leans in with every FOOT where the cycle had it; the untrained walk moves no pelvis
//   moves-game    · a staged fight with the pass on: each side is dealt its training, a blinded man is held bent, a minute runs with every bone finite
//   moves-hands   · the hand pass: an empty hand is relaxed, a grip is kept, a layer's hand is the layer's — and nothing the game reads moves (its head comment below)
//   moves-snap    · a pistol fired from the carry: the wrist eases up, the bare arm stays out from between carry and aim, a pitched shot keeps its pitch; the round's bore and frame unchanged
//   moves-steady  · the crouch walk carried level: the cycle's side-to-side rock most of the way out (head, pelvis, trunk, the width of the base), its stride, pace, height
//                   and mean carriage where they were (hands empty too, and at a creep where the cycle is half the pose); feet in the held gait travel no further on a turn;
//                   setting 2 rides higher; nothing at a crouched stand, upright, or with the part off; and the sprint with the rifle in both hands: the trunk and head stop rolling,
//                   the legs and the gun where they were (hands empty, and a man who does not steady his gun, to the bit)
//
// The family's own red path: MOVES_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts moves-recoil must FAIL (the recoil switched off under the first check).
