// TUT-SOLO-CHECK: the tutorial's solo loud mission (levels/tut-solo.json, its fights in levels/tut-solo.script.ts) played by its scripted player
// (tools/qa/lessons/tut-solo.ts, through the input only) on the tutorial's frame (game/rails.ts: raised here on the frozen stand), nine ways a seed:
//   · as the lines say                      → every step goes by and the mission ends
//   · the sandbags walked STANDING          → the player goes down at that line (the gun's traverse is over a crouched head and through a standing chest)
//   · the gap crossed with NO SMOKE up      → the player goes down at that line (the gap is hosed until a smoke can has gone off between it and the gun)
//   · six seconds on the road EAST OF THE VAN, in the sentry's line, before anything else → every step still goes by (he holds his fire for a man there)
//   · stood at each PIER of the arch under the last two's fire, and the first grenade a DUD from too close → every step still goes by (a show of fire is
//     aimed at places, never at him; a dud lets nobody go and leaves the line up)
//   · a long burst into the wall BESIDE THE INNER DOOR, not one round in the leaf → the line goes by on the burst, the script opens the door as the
//     reload's line comes up, and every step still goes by (the way on never hangs on the door splintering)
//   · the stun grenade thrown down the store's doorway and THE LINE NOT LEFT → his own can blinds him (where the page's rule for it is on: samstun.ts) and
//     every step still goes by; as the lines say he steps aside and it must not
//   · the four CHECKPOINTS                  → down at the sandbags and again at the gap, Enter puts him back at the gate each time (the inner door out and
//     the rifle full, as the checkpoint was kept); the other three are put
//     back by the harness a step after each is kept; every beat played again from its first line, the last two men spawned once → every step goes by
// The two lessons that are about not getting shot are only lessons if they can be failed: a mission where the wrong way also works teaches nothing.
//   bun run tools/qa/tut-solo-check.ts [--seeds 1,2]        and again with TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front (the stand the page opens on)
//   TUT_SOLO_BREAK=1 …   the standing arm is played crouched, as the line says: nobody goes down there, and the check must be RED
// EXIT: 0 = all nine as said on every seed · 1 = a fault, each a line.
// Then THE SHOP'S LAMP: the ground beside the door is lit by that lamp and dark without it (the line that has him shoot it out says the dark is cover).
// Last, THE PAGE'S KIT: on a lesson's page (kit.ts kitIssuedPage) he carries this level's own card, not the plain issue every other lesson is played with.
// Headless: no GPU, no smoke sight lines, nothing here saw a picture or heard a round.
