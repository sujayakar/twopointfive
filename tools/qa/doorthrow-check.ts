// on either stand (the frozen stand holds it off, and its doors swing both ways: the lines hold on both).
//   fault      the rule off: Sam walks at a shut door with a man stood behind it — the man holds it shut on him, and nothing happens to the man
//   walked     the rule on, the same walk: the man is carried clear and the door opens; he is STARTLED — stopped for DOORTHROW.startle, suspicious, the
//              doorway his place to look — and neither folded nor blind, nor on a knee, nor hurt; with the AI on and nobody to see he goes to the
//              doorway, looks about and is back at his round; the start he gets is the shared one (startle.ts: the jolt, his gun down for the beat)
//   opened     a leaf flung open (a door order's shove), and the player's own push at it (Doors.use): the same startle, no fold
//   slammed    a defender at a run shoulders the door open onto one of Sam's men: folded and blind for DOORTHROW.pushSecs, on his feet — wherever along
//              the leaf the runner meets it and however far behind it the man stands; a leaf an alerted man flings open at that pace is the same slam
//   booted     a boot (Doors.kickIn) with the man stood right at the door: folded and blind for DOORTHROW.kickSecs, on a knee for it, unhurt; a man stood
//              further round the swing: the boot's seconds, on his feet
//   sam        a defender's boot onto Sam: folded for the boot's seconds (SAMSTUN reads it: shown on the shipped stand), in a crouch, not down
//   teammate   a defender's boot onto one of Sam's men: the same as any man, and he comes back alert toward the door
//   calm       a defender who is not alert walking a door open onto one of Sam's men: the leaf stops against him as it did; the same man alert: the
//              leaf moves him aside (and no more: Sam's men know whose door it is)
//   own side   a man walking a door open onto one of his own side, or flinging it: nothing (the leaf stops against him); the same walk by a foe: startled;
//              a BOOT throws a man of the kicker's own side like anyone
//   not        eased by a hand, leaned open slower than DOORTHROW.minSpeed, set open by a script in one frame, walked open at a crouch, pulled toward the
//              men on its pull face (one-way doors), swinging shut, a man walking into a leaf himself: nobody is moved, startled or thrown
//   again      a man just up from a fold is not thrown again inside DOORTHROW.again — an OPENED leaf moves and startles him like anyone
//   folded     a folded man holds no door shut: a leaf walked at him at a crouch, or by one of his own side, carries him and opens
//   checkpoint a man on a knee, saved and loaded into a fresh game, is still folded and on his knee to the same clock; a boot saved in flight still throws
//   journal    a recording from before the table replays with the rule off; one that carries it keeps its own word; one from the first cut of it (no
//              `soft` key) replays an opened leaf as the fold it was recorded with
// DOORTHROW_BREAK=1: the rule is left off where the lines want it on — red.
