// EACH MAN'S OWN PICTURE OF THE FIGHT — the check behind PICTURE.on (src/game/picture.ts: on in the page, ?nopicture; off on the frozen stand, TPS_PICTURE=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/picture-check.ts        (also `probes.ts picture`)
// On the office with a squad of four (room-clear-four), one defender staged where the lines want him, everybody made proof against rounds:
//   (a) HIS OWN: a teammate with eyes on the defender has an idea of him, seen, where he stands; a teammate behind a wall has none (the net held shut);
//   (b) TOLD: the net open, the second man is told — the first man's place, as old as his sighting, by his name; the defender has his own idea of the man he sees;
//   (c) OUT OF DATE: the first man out of sight of the place, the defender walks off unseen — nobody's idea follows him: it stays where he was and grows older, and counts for less;
//   (d) LOST: the first man comes to the place and the man is not there — his idea is marked lost and counts for less again;
//   (e) SAFE: a spot in the believed place's line is exposed, one behind the wall is not; the spots come back safest first; an old idea reaches further (the
//       places he may have walked to);
//   (f) COVER: every place rated as cover is beside something solid and out of every believed line;
//   (g) BY EAR: a shot from a man nobody sees puts him, heard, where the sound came from;
//   (h) DOWN: a man dropped out of sight is still believed up; the man who sees the body knows, and the net is told;
//   (i) a checkpoint carries every idea, its age and how it was come by;
//   (j) the memory alone moves nothing: on with every rule that asks it off, the run digests as the run with the switch off;
//   (k) STAND-OFF: a door whose latch-side file is in a known enemy's line — the men are dealt the other file; the rule off, or the switch, the file as it was;
//   (l) COVER: a pinned man whose cover from the shooter is in a second known enemy's line shifts to a place hidden from both; the rule off, the place as it was;
//   (n) GRENADE: a man getting off a live grenade whose spot out of the blast is in a known enemy's line takes another the blast has no line to either; the
//       rule off, the spot as it was;
//   (p) STACK: at a door where a mark the walls deal is in a known enemy's line the order files on one hand of the door, plainly less seen, every mark on the
//       room's floor, none behind glass that was not, none in a doorway; men who stand on their marks keep them; the rule off, the marks as they were;
//   (o) FALL BACK: a defender giving his room up, who believes an enemy to be on the spot he would hold a door from, takes one out of that man's line; one
//       believed in the doorway, he leaves by another door or takes cover in the room; the rule off, the door and the spot as they were;
//   (q) STEP: a man in the file behind Sam, Sam standing, who learns his place is in an enemy's line takes cover a step or two off it that no believed
//       enemy has a line to, and keeps it; a man with a target in his eyes does not; the idea gone stale, his place is his again; the rule off, he keeps the place;
//   (r) DEALT AGAIN: the maintainer's tape (The pass, the charge on the bunk room's long wall): three men stood off with nobody known, then the team learns
//       of the men it knew of on the tape — a man whose mark is now under known fire is dealt one under less of it, still out of the blast, and walks to
//       it; nobody else moves; the rule off, every mark stays;
//   (s) A COLLEAGUE'S SHOT: a man who hears a colleague fire places the enemy where the SHOOTER believes him, as old as that word is; his own newer fix he keeps;
//       the rule off, the true place;
//   (t) THE MAN WHO DROPS HIS GUN AND RUNS (runner.ts, PICTURE.run): his way is the same with an enemy he knows nothing of standing on it as with nobody
//       there; a man he was TOLD is there turns it, though nobody stands there; a word he has forgotten, or a place he has seen empty, turns nothing; out
//       of the building, stopped, a man's eyes on him he knew nothing of: he has that man, and is not taken off the floor while he is watched; the rule
//       off, the unseen man's TRUE place turns it, as it was;
//   (m) WALL CHARGE: with the fog of war on and no record of a man, the stand-off's known enemies (wallcharge.ts knownFoes) have him where a teammate's
//       picture has him; the rule off, or an idea older than the stand-off counts, he is not known.
// PICTURE_BREAK=1 = the switch left off where the lines want it on: they are asked all the same and must fail.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
