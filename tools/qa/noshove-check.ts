// TEAMMATES FALLING IN NEVER SHOVE YOU — the check behind src/game/noshove.ts (NOSHOVE.on: on in the page, ?noshove=0; off on the frozen stand, TPS_NOSHOVE=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/noshove-check.ts [--verbose]      (also `probes.ts noshove`, family squadorders; run it on BOTH stands: plain, and TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front)
// (probes.ts holds ORDERS.propRound off for this check, WAYS_AS_THEY_WERE: line 9's staging is by the ways the men walked before it. Run alone on the
// shipped stand: TPS_PROPROUND=0 in front.)
// Headless; nothing here looks at a picture. room-clear-four with the other side put far off the floor, the switch thrown by hand after the stand-up; the
// player stands with no key down unless a line says he walks. Each line is played with the switch off (the flaw must SHOW) and on (it must be gone):
//   1. THE CASE IT WAS FOUND IN, staged small: 'fall in' with one man a pace from the player and his place on the player's far side — off, the player is
//      shouldered aside and the squad reads him as walking; on, he is not moved, the man goes round him and is in his place;
//   2. THE WALK FROM A DISTANCE, square on and a foot off his line (the 'near enough already' rule held off so the man walks to his exact place): the same;
//   3. NO ROOM TO GO ROUND (the player stood in a passage): on, the man squeezes past and the player is not moved; with `through` off he stops short and waits;
//   4. HIS PLACE UNDER THE PLAYER: he stops short of it, at the ring, and the player is not moved;
//   5. LEFT STANDING IN THE PLAYER'S KEEP-OFF (set down on top of each other): the man steps back out, the player stays;
//   6. THE PLAYER STILL CANNOT WALK THROUGH A FOLLOWER: walked at one under his own keys (stepping out of his way held off), he gets no nearer than his keep-off;
//   7. A SHOVE IS NOT HIS WALKING (`own`): a teammate on ANOTHER order walks into the standing player — he is still shouldered (that man is not falling
//      in), but the pace the squad reads off him stays under the 'walking' bar and a follower standing in the line of the shove does not step aside (off: he does);
//   8. the arithmetic of `own`: a standing man shoved reads 0; a walk into a man who stands reads the ground he covered; a walk shouldered sideways reads his walk;
//   9. A ROOM KEEPER (the compound, the room taken through k_p, 'fall in' with the player stood inside — the case of the finding, which is the SHIPPED stand's:
//      the frozen stand's entry walks nobody across him): off, the player is shoved and the keeper walks out of his way; `own` alone, the player is shoved
//      and the keeper's legs stay still; on, nobody is moved;
//  10. the journal: a recording from before the key replays with it off, one that carries it keeps its own word.
// NOSHOVE_BREAK=1 = the module answers as if the switch were off in the 'on' arms: lines 1 to 9 must fail.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
