// THE CAMERA RUNS ITSELF (src/host/autocam.ts AUTOCAM; the mode in src/host/findme.ts AUTOVIEW; the loop's part in src/host/loop.ts). The page has the
// switch on (`?autocam=0` off); the module's own stand has it off, so both of the harness's stands start without it and this check raises it itself.
//   bun run tools/qa/autocam-check.ts            (also `probes.ts autocam`, family `player`)
//   TPS_PROFILE=shipped bun run tools/qa/autocam-check.ts      — the same lines on the page's stand
// THE FRAME, from scenes handed to it (no game):
//   1 nothing    nothing to frame: the look-at is his feet and the zoom the hand's own
//   2 door       a door ahead: the look-at goes toward the floor past it and stops inside the box he stays in; he is still in the middle of the screen
//   3 fight      a man he could shoot takes the frame from a door on his other side; the zoom goes out to hold him and never comes in while he is there
//   4 hold       a button down: the frame does not move
//   5 turn       the thing framed on the lens's side, his feet still: a turn is asked and lands with it up the screen; none while he walks, with a
//                button down, with a man he could shoot, just after a shot, with something in his hands' way, with `turn` off, or inside `gap` of the last
//   6 wall       a wall between the lens and him: the least turn that clears him
// THE LOOP, the whole Game under stepFrame (the loop the page runs), free step and fixed:
//   7 as it was  the switch on and the mode never put on: the same game and the same view as with the switch off (CONTROL: no break word touches it)
//   8 mode       the camera's key tapped twice puts the mode on and the view comes round to where he looked; the mouse moved past a tremor under the
//                key puts it off, a tremor does not; the key held with a walk key puts it off, and two taps with a walk key held put it ON
//   9 a door     in the mode, walking at a way out: the look-at runs ahead of him toward the floor past it; standing by it with the lens on the far
//                side the view comes round, his aim does not swing, and no turn begins while a walk key is down
//  10 a man      a hostile man in his line takes the frame; the same man hidden by the fog takes nothing
//  11 others'    a pin, a spectated man: the mode frames nothing and the view is theirs
//  12 reads      the scene read every frame of a run and never used: the same game (CONTROL)
//  13 plumbing   the two stands by their words, the FROZEN_HOLDS row, a recording from before the key (CONTROL)
// THE HAND'S OWN TUNING (AUTOCAM.tune; lines 1 to 16 run with it off, on the numbers as built):
//  17 modes      off = every number the module's whatever is chosen; on = the gentle mode where nobody has chosen, each mode its numbers, a row moved is
//                the player's own and put back is the mode's again, a table written from outside is not shown as the mode's, what is kept reads back
//                held to what a row can be put to (and a line that is not one is refused whole), reset
//  18 calmer     gentle makes no turn at rest for a thing on the lens's side and still makes one for a wall, and each reason has its own row; an eased
//                turn starts from rest, never passes its top speed, has no step in it, lands on the yaw asked without going past, every notch of its
//                speed is a quicker turn, a goal gone to the other side or a faster turn handed on is braked without a step, and one ended midway dies
//                away; a lean speed over the one as built is reached, and a fight's lean at none leans nothing for his walk; the frame's share and the
//                zoom's share scale the lean and the travel, to none
//  19 the loop   the whole Game: with the swing off the double tap puts the mode on and turns nothing, with it on the view comes round eased, and a
//                shot ends a slow swing where it is; a wall hiding him brings the view round by the eased turn, tick by tick under its top speed,
//                though the mouse moves; a walk key ends it without a step, and the next turn waits out the gap from there
//  20 plumbing   the two stands by their words, the FROZEN_HOLDS rows, a recording from before the key (CONTROL)
//  21 the lock   (AUTOCAM.lock) a man who is not onto him holds the frame by how near he is: the look-at goes to the middle of the two and the camera
//                comes in by `lockIn`, more the stronger the lock, from rest and with no step; a held button stills it and a stalk's held click does
//                not; a second man he could shoot is never zoomed out of the picture; `lockIn` at none comes in nowhere; off = the frame as it was
//  22 the loop   the whole Game: a man in his line who is not onto him, closed on in stages: the camera comes in at each, never by a step; the man
//                onto him, it goes back out (it never comes in on a fight); a plain held button stills it
//  23 plumbing   the two stands by their words, the FROZEN_HOLDS row, a recording from before the key (CONTROL)
// AUTOCAM_BREAK=1 = the switch left off: lines 8, 9, 10, 11 (and 15, 19, 22) must FAIL.   AUTOTUNE_BREAK=1 = the tuning left off: 17, 18 and 19 must
