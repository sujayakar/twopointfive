// who is hostile to whom, AI men perceiving / targeting / shooting hostile AI men through the same senses they use on Sam, the spawn / despawn / engage seam
// the stage lane calls, and above all IDENTITY: with no unit spawned the guards-versus-Sam game is the game it was, frame for frame and round for round.
//   teams-identity  a seeded 45 s fight staged like weapons-identity's guard section and then let off the leash (a second man freed, Sam teleported out of their
//                   sight and back): a digest of every man's state / position / aim / awareness / fix and of Sam's, every frame, plus the frames the rounds left
//                   on — FROZEN on the tree before the teams change (EXPECT below); the tree with teams must reproduce it exactly. `--print` re-measures it.
//   teams-table     the hostility table, both ways round, for every pair of sides.
//   teams-fight     two operatives (FN2000) and two hostiles (AKS-74U) spawned nine metres apart up the cubicles' north aisle, lit, in each other's sight, all four
//                   put in the fight by engage(): inside six seconds somebody is dead, rounds went BOTH ways (the shot events by who fired them), nobody ever had a
//                   man of his own side as his foe, and the three staff guards parked on the lot said and radioed nothing and the floor's alarm never moved.
//   teams-player    an operative two metres in front of a lit Sam for five seconds never takes him as a foe (friendly) and never fires; a hostile put in the same
//                   place has him as his foe inside a second.
//   teams-dark      a hostile standing in the dark (his room's lights out) round a partition from an alert operative: not acquired in five seconds; the moment he
//                   fires the operative has a fix on him (heard); lights back on and in the open, acquired by sight inside two seconds.
//   teams-despawn   spawn four, despawn them: the guards list, the light list, the character ids and the probe keys are back to what they were, and a headless
//                   showcase tour run straight after in the same process passes.
