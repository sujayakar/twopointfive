// The 'light-wall' probe: A TEAMMATE'S LIGHT IS DARK INTO THE WALL AT HIS MUZZLE (guards.ts LIGHTS.wallOff — wallDark / wallDarkSeen). Run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts light-wall        (family: litman)
// PASS / FAIL each, headless (bang-tally.ts stage()). The squad is given the orders a player gives — fall in, stack on the nearest door, open and clear — with
// the light discipline rule held off and the team bare-eyed, so every weapon light burns as its unit's switch has it; every frame the probe casts ITS OWN rays
// (the lens to seven points across the beam, the rule's geometry at a margin either side of its two distances) and keeps its own clock:
//   · with the switch off the flaw is there: frames of a burning light whose whole beam has ended at arm's length for longer than the rule would allow
//   · with it on there is no such frame, and the rule did hold lights dark
//   · it burns again at once: no frame where the rule has him dark and any ray runs clear past the far distance
//   · nobody but the team is asked: no hostile man's reading is ever dark
//   · off, nothing reads the rule's numbers: the same game frame for frame with them moved
//   · the stand's own word, and a recording carries the key
// What it cannot say: what any of it looks like (never seen on a GPU), or whether it helps a fight — that is playthrough.ts's tally.
// The probe's own red path: WALLLIGHT_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts light-wall must FAIL (the rule answers "not dark" with its switch on).
