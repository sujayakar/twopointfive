// THE MISSIONS GATE — every mission on the Missions list (src/scene/scenarioList.ts SCENARIOS and QUIET_MISSIONS) played to its end: the squad missions by the scripted commander AS SHIPPED,
// the quiet ones (kind 'quiet') by the scripted lone player of tools/qa/solo-night.ts --quiet
// (tools/qa/ships.ts: the shipped profile, src/host/profile.ts), two seeds each — the quiet rows EIGHT (a quiet run is a deal of start × spot × patrol set off its
// seed, and a level can be shut on one deal in a dozen: two seeds never met the crossing's south start with its lane man in the kerb gap; each row's line says how
// many of the level's deals its seeds dealt). `probes.ts missions-shipped` (family missions), or by itself:
//   bun run tools/qa/missions-gate.ts [--seeds 1-2] [--quiet-seeds 1-8] [--jobs N] [--cap <s>] [--json f.json]
// RED: a run that throws, a run that stalls (the commander stuck, the mission not ended inside the cap), a mission of the list that was not played.
// THE CAP is 420 s for the squad rows and 300 s for the quiet ones (--cap sets both). The squad rows' was 300 until a slow WIN went past it: as shipped the
// compound's seed 1 is taken at 312 s with three of four up, and a win is not a stall. The other 41 end by 180 s. Why that run is long, and what
// would bring the cap back toward 300: docs/agents/qa.md, the bullet on this cap.
// NOT judged: who won, how many came out, the smells — those are the tallies' business (playthrough.ts's own report is printed under the verdict lines).
// THE COMMANDER HERE HUNTS FIRST (PT_HUNT=first, playthrough.ts): once no room is held he goes for whoever is left before he walks the rooms again. His default
// walks every room first, and with the last man standing out in the open that ran the compound's seed 2 to the cap with the team 4 of 4 (the hunt began 19 s
// before it). This gate judges a stall, never who won; the order does change which end a few rows reach (3 of 42 here), so a row is played again with
// `PT_HUNT=first bun run tools/qa/ships.ts --trace <id>:<seed>`, and the tallies, which keep the default, are not to be read off this gate. PT_HUNT=rooms in the
// caller's env = the default order under the gate (any other word, or none: first). The report line says which was run.
// About five minutes at --jobs 4 on four cores. Exit 0 = every mission ended on every seed, 1 = a red line.
