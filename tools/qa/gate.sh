# Run probe families and report EVERY sub-family verdict (a family prints several '=== name: … ===' lines; reading only the last one hid a red
# breach-run for a day — review 08-10 #2/#4). Counts check lines in BOTH shapes the probe files print ('- PASS — …' and the two-space '  PASS …' of the
# editor / level probes). A family is RED when any FAIL / error line appears, probes.ts exits non-zero (1 = a probe failed, 2 = unknown family — nothing
# ran), or it printed neither a verdict line nor a single counted check (an ERROR: a green made of nothing). Exit 0 all green, 1 any red, 2 if the only
# red was an unknown family name.  Usage: tools/qa/gate.sh fam1 fam2 …   (GATE_TIMEOUT=secs overrides the 1500 s cap per family; `all-quick` = the union of
# the gate lists lanes are told to run, see probes.ts)
# The per-family time cap wants a timeout(1) binary — GNU coreutils' `timeout` or Homebrew's `gtimeout`; a stock macOS has neither and the gate used to die on
# its first line there. With neither on the PATH a perl alarm stands in (exit 142 on the cap instead of 124), and failing that the family runs uncapped, said so.
