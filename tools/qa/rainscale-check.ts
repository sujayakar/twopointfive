// A SPLASH IS THE SAME SPLASH AT EVERY ZOOM — the check behind the scene prelude's RAIN_SCALE (src/render/frame.ts rainScaleConfig; on, ?norainscale at
// boot = as it was; picture only: no game table, nothing for a recording to carry).
//   bun run tools/qa/checks.ts rainscale        RAINSCALE_BREAK=1 = the rule off and the same lines asked: must FAIL
// the maintainer, 10-19, three zooms of one yard in the rain: "the low res rain isn't scale invariant". The ring a landing drop throws up is drawn in the
// volumetric pass (volumetrics.wgsl splashAt), its line never thinner than that pass's texel at the ground: with the camera pulled back the texel is many
// centimetres and each 2 cm ring was a blob that wide at a ring's full brightness.
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SAY. No shader runs here. The check lifts the scalar lines of splashAt OUT OF THE SHADER'S OWN TEXT (the ring's radius, the
// factor's block, the returned brightness) and runs them as written, over a floor of 9 cm cells sampled with its own die exactly as the function lays them
// out (one ring a cell, the point asked in the ring's own cell) — so what it measures is the light a square metre of ground gets from its rings as the
// texel at the ground grows. A change to those lines that this file can no longer lift is a red line here, not a silent pass. What the picture looks like is
// the page's to show.
