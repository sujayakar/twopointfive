// THE UNPLAYED ROWS STAND APART ON THE MISSION LIST — the check behind `UNPLAYED_UI.on` (src/ui/missions.ts: unplayed, unplayedLast, unplayedClass).
// A row is UNPLAYED when it is `untuned` and the short list does not name it (scene/picks.ts onShortList). With the switch on, a group's unplayed rows come after
// its others and are drawn quieter (`.mrow.unplayed`), the first of them under a break (`.mrow.unplayed.first`); with it off (`?unplayed=0`) the list is the one
// the build drew before.
//   bun run tools/qa/unplayed-check.ts   ·   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts unplayed (family missions)
// Nothing here looks at a picture: the lists are the page's own functions (missionList, the start page's startPageList) and the screens the real openMissions on
// the picker probes' fake DOM — the start page's cards (`tiles`) and the older list. What it holds:
//   1. on, the rule: unplayed(m) is `untuned` and not on the short list, on every row; no short-list row is unplayed
//   2. on, the order (both lists): every mission once, the groups in one run each, in no group a played row after an unplayed one, the short list's rows
//      still first in their group, and the whole order = the switch-off order after a stable partition of each group
//   3. on, the screens (cards and list): the rows stand in the list's order and the keys walk them in it; every unplayed row wears `unplayed` and no other
//      does; `first` is worn by the first unplayed row of each group that holds a played one before it, and by no other; the classes outlive the cursor
//   4. off: both orders are what the code gave before the switch existed (written out again below, not asked of the code), and no row of either screen wears either class
//   5. ?nopicks (the short list off): its untuned rows count as unplayed and go to the back with the rest
//   6. ?nogroups (a flat list): nothing is reordered — the switch moves no row — and its unplayed rows wear `unplayed` alone
//   UNPLAYED_BREAK=1  the switch is left off where the lines above want it on: the check must FAIL (exit 1) — the proof that it can
// exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
