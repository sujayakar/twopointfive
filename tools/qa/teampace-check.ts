// TEAMMATES ARE SLOWER THAN THE PLAYER, AND RUN ONLY FOR A REASON — the check behind src/game/teampace.ts (TEAMPACE.on: on in the page, ?teampace=0; off on the
// frozen stand, TPS_TEAMPACE=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/teampace-check.ts [--verbose]      (also `probes.ts teampace`, family squadorders; run it on BOTH stands: plain, and TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front)
// Headless; nothing here looks at a picture. room-clear-four with the other side put far off the floor, the switch thrown by hand after the stand-up; the player
// is the real player under real keys. Each rule line is run with the switch on AND off and passes only when the rule shows on and the old pace shows off:
//   1. AN ORDERED WALK: the four sent to a spot a long walk off — no man's legs over `k` × the player's walk × his card (off: the orders' brisk 2.0);
//      the player, setting off five seconds after them down the same way, comes up on their last man (off: the team walks away from him);
//   2. FOLLOWING AT A WALK: the player walks the same way with the four fallen in — nobody runs, nobody over `followK` × his walk × his card, nobody left
//      more than a file's length behind when he stops;
//   3. FOLLOWING AT A SPRINT: he sprints it — every follower is at a run with him (off: nobody over PACE.max), gun low while he runs, down to a walk inside
//      a second and a half of his stopping, never into the player's back, in place soon after; each run written down as 'follow';
//   3b. … and not the silent squad: the same sprint under the silent posture, nobody runs;
//   4. A GRENADE: one put down among them — the men who run from it run (off: at the old cap), written down as 'blast'; with `own` off, at the old cap;
//   5. THE FIGHT'S OWN MOVES: a step the room fight orders keeps the pace it had (PACE.max) for its second and a half and no longer;
//   6. COVER (the picture raised for the line): a man the fight is hot for, on floor in the line of a man he knows of, a mark out of that line in plain sight
//      across the same floor — he is given the run; not with the fight cold, not to a mark in the line too, not for a short step, not with `own` off, not
//      the silent squad;
//   7. a sprinter's boots: the footfall's level at a run is the player's own sprint's, and nothing changes under it;
//   8. the journal: a recording from before the key replays with it off, one that carries it keeps its own word.
// TEAMPACE_BREAK=1 = the module answers as if the switch were off in the 'on' arms: lines 1 to 7 must fail (3b apart: nobody runs either way).   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
