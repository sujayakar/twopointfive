// MORE MUSIC THAN THE ONE THEME (src/audio/pieces.ts MUSIC.pieces; music.ts deals the pieces): is the theme untouched with the switch off, does every newer piece play at
// every tension, are they different pieces, and does the deal hand them round? The sequencer is driven here over a recording backend on a made-up clock (no audio device,
// no browser): what is held is WHICH NOTES ARE ASKED FOR AND WHEN. What they sound like is tools/qa/music-page.cjs (levels, measured in Chromium) and a listener's ears.
//   bun run tools/qa/music-check.ts                exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a line failed          (also `probes.ts music`)
//   MUSIC_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/music-check.ts  the red path: every newer piece is the first one over again, no table is the visit's own, nobody says the menu is up or which level it is, a level loses its row, a string in tune is called out of it — 'different', 'foundation', 'a tape', 'the menu', 'every level', "the team's nerves", "the level's music" and 'acoustic' must FAIL
//   run it on BOTH stands (TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front): the 'stand' line says which one it found
// WHAT IS HELD:
//   stand       the switch is off on the frozen stand and on on the shipped one (TPS_MUSIC=1 raises it), has its FROZEN_HOLDS row and its word, and ?onetheme puts it off
//   the theme   switch off: two minutes of the score at calm, suspicious and firefight ask for the notes they asked for before pieces.ts existed (digests pinned from the
//               tree before it), call nothing of the newer voices, and never change piece; a backend WITHOUT the newer voices plays the same with the switch on
//   each piece  on its own for ninety seconds at each tension: it plays, in time (no note in the past, none more than the look-ahead late), within sane pitch and level,
//               not a machine gun; the kit is silent at calm and there in a firefight; it uses voices the theme does not have
//   different   no two pieces (the theme among them) ask for the same notes at any tension, and no two share tempo and metre
//   foundation  Cold Storage and Wire Act stand on a bass line and a break: the line at rest, the break under it once anyone is uneasy, whole in a firefight
//   the deal    an hour of calm on four seeds: the visit opens on a newer piece, every newer one is heard before the theme comes round, none twice running, a
//   every level each mission's level (and the solo night's) has two pieces written for it (audio/setlist.ts), never the theme; no row for a level that is not there
//   the level's music   MUSIC.byLevel: the score plays the level's list in its order whatever the page's die says, its first piece off the menu; a restart keeps it; ?shuffle = the bag
//   the team's nerves   MUSIC.theirs: the tension the score follows (game/guards.ts tension) counts a teammate in live play only in a fight of his own; ?teamnerves = every man, as it was
//   the menu    while the main menu is up (Music.menu) the score asks for the theme's own notes and deals nothing; a piece begins when play does; back on the menu, the theme
//   a tape      a run tape's player (replay/engineplay.ts) writes the tape's knob tables over the page's and leaves MUSIC as the viewer's page has it
//               bar-long swell leads each handover and ends on the new piece's first note; a piece picked by hand is not dealt straight back; a firefight holds a piece to twice its minutes and no longer; a mission that starts early keeps its piece, one that starts late moves on
