// 'runready' — SAM SPRINTS WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE PISTOL (RUNREADY, src/game/character.ts; asked for by src/game/player.ts). The maintainer: "sprinting with
// pistol animation is weird, should keep two hands on it and at low ready, like rifle sprinting animation".
//   bun run tools/qa/runready-check.ts        (also `probes.ts runready`; run it on BOTH stands: TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the second)
//   hands     the pistol in his hand and the sprint held: the animator is told, and over a second of the run his two hands stay together on the gun, below
//             his chest and ahead of him, the muzzle down, and the gun hand keeps its place by his body where the fist pumped.
//             (On the page's stand the run passes a thing inside the gun's reach: for those frames the low ready is the wall rule's own, gunwall.ts, with
//             the key up or down. They are counted apart, and the hands are judged through them too.)
//   back      Shift let go: the gun is back in its carry within half a second, and nothing is left up (no stance was written, the input is down).
//   others    the same sprint with the pistol holstered, and with the rifle in his hands, never tells the animator: the bare arms and the long gun's low
//             ready are as they were.
//   off       the key down: the pistol rides the pumping fist, as it did.
//   harness   the key is a row of the two stands' list with its word, off on the frozen stand and on in the page (`?runready=0` puts it off), rides a
//             recording's tables, and a recording from before the table replays with it off.
// RUNREADY_BREAK=1 = the key left down where hands and back ask for it up: `hands` must FAIL.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: the numbers say where the hands are, not how the run LOOKS.
