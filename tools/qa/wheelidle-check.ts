// THE WHEEL WITH THE RING UP STEPS NOBODY (src/game/orders.ts ringInput, CMDRING.wheelIdle). The maintainer, 10-24, with a recording of the depot:
// "got into a weird state where my command modes (not plan mode) only selected blue team". The recording has a two-finger scroll with the squad's
// ring still up: the wheel stepped who the orders go to, the choice stayed after the ring had gone, and no key steps it back under `only`.
//   bun run tools/qa/wheelidle-check.ts            (also `probes.ts wheelidle`, in family squadorders)
//   TPS_PROFILE=shipped bun run tools/qa/wheelidle-check.ts      — the same lines on the page's stand
// PASS / FAIL each, headless: the room clear on the office with its squad of four under god mode, ONE deal (seed 3: the rule has no die in it), the
// ring put up with its own key the way this stand has it (held, or let go where the ring stays; a stand with no ring is given the ring as built), the
// switch raised here, so both stands ask the same lines. THE SCROLL is the recording's own: its twenty wheel records, tick for tick.
//   1. the scroll with the ring up leaves the orders with everyone, at every record, and the ring is still up.
//   2. the scroll is not his walking pace either (the plain wheel's own job with no ring up): his pace is as it was.
//   3. the ring put away and the key tapped: the order goes to all four.
//   4. a click on a man with the ring up is still him alone, and the scroll after it leaves it his.
//   5. CONTROL — the switch off: the same scroll steps who the orders go to, the choice stays after the ring has gone, and the tap is theirs alone.
//   6. CONTROL (plumbing) — a recording from before the key replays with it off; the frozen stand holds it off, the page's has it on, FROZEN_HOLDS has its row.
// WHEELIDLE_BREAK=1 = the switch left off and the same lines asked: 1 and 3 must fail.
//   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
