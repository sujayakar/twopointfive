// The 'he40' family (game/he40.ts — the FN2000 launcher's 40 mm high-explosive round: the launcher's second load beside the ring airfoil), run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts he40 | he40-keys | he40-burst | he40-dud | he40-preview | he40-quiet
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts, its staging borrowed from fn2000-probes.ts). No picture and no sound here: the round in the air, the
// burst, the stand-in thump, the reticle's word and the dud on the floor are untested by eye and ear.
//   he40-keys     a fresh rifle has the RING up (never nothing); 2 again with the rifle up flips RING ⇄ 40 MM and says so both ways; the kit column's row 2
//                 carries 'RING ×5' and '40MM ×3', the one that is up lit; the right button is press-then-release: no arc at rest, the press frame holds the
//                 arc and sends nothing (and no plain checkpoint while it is held), the next frame sends one and the count drops; a press inside the tube's
//                 reload is refused and begins nothing; held, the arc stays up and nothing goes; Esc (Game.escape, and the key inside a frame) drops it
//                 unsent and the button still down begins nothing; letting go of a held one sends one; with none left it says so (and where the other load
//                 is); a checkpoint keeps the count and the load, a file from when 'nothing' could be selected (attIdx −1) loads with the RING up, and none
//                 is written while a round is in the air; your kit card has the row and it sets the count
//   he40-burst    a man 14 m down the corridor: the arc on the press frame reads armed, one right click, the round is there in under half a second and he is
//                 dead — by frag.ts's blast (one report in FRAG_LOG named '40 mm grenade', one 'bang' event flagged frag, ONE call into the destruction lane),
//                 no gunfire event, the tube's thump a 'prop' at Sam; Sam, 14 m off, is not in the report
//   he40-dud      the same man 5 m off: no blast at all (no report, no bang, no destruction call) — he folds and is alert, alive; a 'shell' item lies there and
//                 stays inert; a wall 3 m off: a dud and a clack nobody made; a wall 9 m off: the burst — and Sam, standing where he fired from, untouched
//   he40-preview  the previewed arc IS the flight (three arcs, within 6 cm), and 'armed' read off the preview agrees with what the round then does
//   he40-quiet    with the 40 mm never put on the button (the RING is the load a fresh rifle has up) nothing of it runs: no round in the air, the digest's rifle word unchanged ('… r5', no 'g'), the ring still
//                 flies its own table (launcher.ts ringSolve ≡ arcSolve by RING)
