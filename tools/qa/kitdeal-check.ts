// THE SQUAD'S KIT IS DEALT OVER THE MEN WHO COME (src/game/kit.ts KITDEAL, deal, kitTeam).
//
//   bun run tools/qa/kitdeal-check.ts          (KITDEAL_BREAK=1 = the deal hands everything to the first two men again: the 'nobody comes bare' lines must fail)
//
// The issued kit and every named squad kit are written down as the first two teammates carry them, so a team of three or four showed the others with a gun
// and four empty pouches ("as issued still has blue team pretty empty"). The deal is how the table's cards are WORN, never a rewrite of them. This check
// asks, of the kit table alone: with three or four coming no man wears nothing while the kit has a thing for him, each pair of the four has a charge and a
// stun of its own as issued, the squad's count is the count it was at every size under every kit and the table's cards are the cards they were, a counted
// thing changed on a teammate's card makes the worn cards the player's own while any other change leaves the layout (so a smaller team still carries the
// whole kit), a peek writes nothing, a size-specific layout never reaches the store unasked, and men put back on their shares are the named kit again. Of a
// staged game: the men of a team of four on The pass carry the worn cards, a smaller team staged after the screen stood on four counts what it counts
// with the screen stood on its own size (under a block that names only you too), and the long hall's own issue stages the same dealt cards whoever's
// layout the stored cards are. Of the Team & kit screen (a headless DOM): the roster of four shows things on both Blue men and marks nobody changed.
// Looks at no picture: never seen on a GPU.
//
// SINCE 2026-11-07 the deal and its key `more` are settled on and this check writes neither: every line is asked of the rule as the page has it. What
// went: each line's "with the deal off" run and what it was compared with (the same count on as off, the same run by digest, "what the deal alone gave"),
// the two "switch off" controls, the `more`-off pin the first family stood on (its lines now ask of the whole rule), and the probe kitdeal-stands (the
// two stands' words and a recording from before the key). Where a staged line had the deal-off run as its control, the control is now the same team
// with the screen left on its own size.
//
// `KITDEAL.more` (KITMORE_BREAK=1 = nobody is lent a tool and nobody is handed the canister: the 'a tool each pair' lines must fail).
// kitdeal-more asks what the key adds: of three or four as issued Red Two wears the breaching shotgun and, of four, Blue Two the hammer;
// no card of the table or the store ever holds a lent tool — not after another row is changed, not after a counted thing is — so a pair comes as it
// did; a big thing put on by hand is his; a slot emptied by hand stays empty (the lent tool taken off, or a
// thing put on by hand and cleared again) and moves nothing a smaller team carries; a card shows what every press of the big row said; cards that leave
// a named kit keep its empty slots; and the Quiet kit of four has a canister for its fourth man, which the squad's count holds. kitdeal-run stages
// them: the men carry the tools, the door tools have the big slot's row, a pair staged after the screen stood on four carries none.
