// FINDING YOUR OWN MAN, AND THE CAMERA UNDER THE HAND — the check behind src/host/findme.ts, src/ui/findme.ts and src/render/outline.ts (eleven settings in Options > Game, every one
// starting where the game stood before it had them but the outline's four and the camera's two, which the PAGE starts at the maintainer's own: (12)).
//   bun run tools/qa/findme-check.ts        (also `probes.ts findme`; the same on both stands)
// Headless: the whole Game under stepFrame, the loop the page runs, with nothing drawn; where the HUD would draw the ring is asked of findMeRing itself, and
// the outline's pass is run on a stand-in device that writes down what it was asked for (what the rim LOOKS like is the page's to show: findme-page.cjs).
//   table    (1) a harness has no store: the table is the starts; a kept line that is missing, broken or out of range reads as the starts, a good one as itself;
//                a row moved is kept alone (the rows still at their starts are not written, so a start tuned later reaches them), and moved back, nothing is;
//   as was   (2) with the table at its starts the follow camera is not written (its lead is the lead it was built with, to the bit) and a hand's orbit turns
//                the view by exactly what it always did, on the free step and the fixed one;
//            (3) the ring and the outline ON, and asked every frame, against both off: one seed, one scripted hand — the same game digest for digest and
//                the same view to the bit (picture only: nothing a man senses, nothing the light meter reads);
//   pan      (4) at none the camera's look-at is the man himself with the cursor six metres off; at half it leans half of what it did; back at full, as built;
//   turn     (5) reversed, the same hand turns the view the other way by the same angle (free step and fixed);
//   behind   (6) the camera key tapped twice: the view comes round over a few tenths of a second (not in one frame) to look where he looked at the tap, and
//                stops there; with the row off the taps do nothing; a pixel of orbit on the tap's own frame does not lose it; a hand's orbit after that, or
//                a pin taking the view, drops a turn under way; taps under the pause card are not kept; with the cursor to one side of
//                him at the tap he still looks where he looked when the view has come round (his aim carried: host/findme.ts AimCarry);
//            (9) that carry: a hand's tremor on the mouse keeps it and so does walking; the mouse moved, a click, a key that may read the cursor, the row
//                put off or the pause card gives the game's cursor back to the mouse, to the pixel, before the tick reads it;
//            (7) what is a double tap: two short presses, and only that — never one held press however long it repeats, never a tap and a hold, a press with
//                another key or an orbit in it, or two taps far apart; three quick taps are one;
//   picture  (8) the ring is at his feet, gone when he is down and nothing with its row off; the shelved setting (his shape through a wall) is not in the
//                table and a kept line that names it reads without it;
//            (10) the outline: its frame is off with the row off, the man down or the page saying his marks are hidden; on, it names his owner byte,
//                a box on the picture he stands inside and that is a small part of it (empty when he is behind the lens), and a strength that comes up
//                in the dark, goes in the light and under the goggles, and is the meter's word at once on a frame with no time in it; the pass asks the device
//                for NOTHING while the frame is off, builds one program the first frame it is on and draws nothing until that program is there, then one
//                scissored draw inside the box; nothing at no strength or with him off the picture; a program that fails is never drawn or asked again;
//                what the rim covers is its own (OUTLINE) times the width row, read each frame: less at every step down the row on a tall composite
//                and a short one, nothing at all at none (the frame off), never over four pixels; the strength row is the rim's opacity (none = the
//                frame off); the two light rows are the ends the strength fades between, by the light.
//                BY THE PICTURE (the row 'Outline fades by', as it starts): the frame says so and carries the picture's own two ends (not the meter's); the pass, handed a copy
//                of the composite, draws though the meter says lit, with those ends and the exposure in the slot and the copy bound; with no copy,
//                or the row on the meter, it goes by the meter's word; the goggles take it out either way. What the shader makes of the copy is the
//                page's to show (findme-squad-page.cjs).
//            (11) his teammates: every living man of his squad has a rim of his own — by his own light, in his pair's colour (the colour row from
//                the pale ink to yellow, red and blue), covering the teammates' row's share of what the player's covers (none = no teammate; never over
//                the cap) — a man dead gives his place up; one render pass, a scissored draw a man from his own slot and under his own box, the
//                player's last, his place kept in a crowd; a box across the lens off to the side is empty; the game's digest is not moved by any of
//                it, and a squad stepped with the outline on and filled every frame ends digest for digest where the same squad ends with it off.
//   starts   (12) THE PAGE'S STARTS (host/findme.ts FINDME_TUNED, findMeStarts; host/profile.ts pageSwitches, `?findtuned=0`): the page with no word starts
//                the outline ON at the maintainer's own width, teammates' width and colour, the aim pan at none and the turn the other way, and
//                `findtuned=0` starts every row as built; a machine that kept nothing gets the rim (the frame on, a quarter wide, the teammates' at
//                four fifths), a camera handed over with no lead and a turn under the camera's key the other way round; one that kept a row keeps it
//                (Normal chosen by hand is kept, and the pan put back to its full) — a row
//                put Off by hand stays off and its line is not written away, under the word either; a line that kept the tuned numbers by hand is
//                the same table and is written again as only what still differs; a row moved under the word is written into the line as it
//                lies; a store that may not be read still gets the page's starts; Reset puts the starts in force back; the switch is on the
//                stands' books and this stand was booted as its profile says. Lines (1) to (11) are the
//                rows' own and run on the starts AS BUILT whatever the stand booted with (put back as found at the end).
// FINDME_BREAK=1 = the rows are moved and the table is not (the settings do nothing): (4), (5), (6), (8), (9), (10) and (11) must fail.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
