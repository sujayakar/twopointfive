// THE BOTTOM LAYER OF A PILE A BLOWN HOLE TAKES GOES WITH IT — the check behind FURN.mouth.base (src/game/furnblast.ts mouth; on in the page, ?holebase=0;
// off in the module and on the frozen stand, TPS_HOLEBASE=1; acts only with FURN.mouth.on).
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts holebase        (family `furnblast`)        HOLEBASE_BREAK=1 = the rule off and the same lines asked: must FAIL
// the maintainer, 10-17, of two wall charges on the pass (levels/pass.json): "one set of guys couldn't pathfind through the wall breach". The store keeps sacks
// in piles against that wall, each layer 0.2 m thick. The blast took the layers above and left the bottom one lying in the hole: the hole rule passes over
// what is no higher than a step (top at or under 0.2 m), and the furniture's own bands never list a thing that low. The feet's side of it is UNDERFOOT
// (collision.ts, its own check `underfoot`); this is the blast's side.
// THE SITE: his own (the store's outer wall by the floor point 31.3, 5.0, set from the yard side), on a fresh stand of the level with the page's destruction
// switches (and its lived-in rooms, LIVED.on: the piles are the store's own dressing, and the frozen stand holds that off): a charge set as the order sets it
// and blown as F blows it. Then what is left of the two piles by the hole, read off the level's own boxes.
// THE BARS, on the same site with the piles reshaped by the check before the level stands: the right pile's bottom layer made a MAT (0.06 m thick, under the rule's baseThick, the layers
// above let down onto it) and a thing the hole rule never takes (a block up past its height bar) stood on the left pile's bottom layer. Both bottom layers
// must stay. The low bank at the wall's foot (top 0.17 m, nothing on it) must stay at every site.
// THE ONE INDEX (src/game/things.ts, THINGS.on) is held OFF under the lines above: they are of this rule on the furniture's own bands, which never list a thing
// that low. Under the index a low sack is a thing like any other and the blast takes it without this rule; the last line asks that, on the same site.
