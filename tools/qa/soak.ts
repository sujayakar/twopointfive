// Long randomized headless soak of the gameplay layer: the real Game (see headless.ts for what is real and what is stubbed) stepped at a fixed rate for tens of
// simulated minutes per seed under a seeded random schedule of stimuli — gunshot / kick / bang events, kills, the player teleported onto guards, lit in their
// cones, bumping them, doors picked / kicked / slammed, blackouts, restarts and guard resets, escalation raised / stood down, forced room clears interrupted at
// whatever phase they are in, AI and tour toggles — while a set of invariants is asserted every frame and softer smells are counted.

// Everything random goes through one seeded PRNG per stream (the game's own Math.random included), so a violation is reproducible from its seed + frame
// (re-running the same seed replays the same frames exactly; ~1 s of wall clock per simulated minute). Invariants checked every frame: no exception; nothing
// NaN / out of the world; guard state / awareness / speed sane; no dead man scripted, no orphan script, no clearing while the tour flag or AI-off is up;
// escalation level and clock consistent, no lockdown duty below lockdown; doors never latched-open / locked-and-broken / out of range; pick ∈ [0,1];
// followers' leaders alive; nobody stuck (ordered to move 4 s, went nowhere — reported with the doors / props / nav facts around him), planted on a nav-blocked
// cell with somewhere to be (1.5 s if no plan can leave it, 5 s otherwise — 'blocked-cell-stuck': the stranding a hold ending in a nook used to leave, guards.ts un-stick), overlapping a colleague
// > 2 s, popping > 0.3 m in a frame (bar the un-stick's own logged snap), or standing inside static geometry; no alert man rooted at a doorway 6 s with nothing he fires reaching Sam; the
// player's wall hold (Q, pressed at random with the wander keys) only ever on a free man, on its plane and inside its run, bladed, peeking only at an
// open end, and nothing of it left once he is off; the rounds Sam carries (chamber + mag + spares) never rise within one life and no interaction row is ever
// about a gun on the floor (dropped weapons are set dressing, not pickups); mission stages only forward; every downed man carries how he went down (and no living man does),
// a witness record only ever names a man who IS down (found bodies as breathing exactly when they are), and no witness record changes in a frame stepped
// with the AI off; the interrogation engine (dialogue.ts, leaned on at random through Game.interrogate or the bare engine): no exception, no unresolved
// {token} in anything said, no line written for a knowledge level other than the man's own, one stage forward per press and never back for that man;
// the grab / hold (player.ts Hold, driven at random through the real rows — a Space tap on 'grab him', or Space held so the list opens and the grab lands on the
// release — and the held man's rows, holstered or drawn: grab the nearest calm man from behind, question him (his top row, tapped), walk him about, now and then
// draw / holster on him with E (player.ts swapHold, either way, sometimes back again), then choke him out (arm: the choke's row chosen and tapped, sometimes
// stopped by a second tap) or fire past him / pistol-whip him / check the whip (gun); the takedown likewise through its click with the hands empty; the Space
// selector's own shape asserted throughout — open only under a held key, a running verb alone in the list with its bar, no second verb over a running one):
// Player.holding and
// the one Guard.held always agree both ways (phase and variant), the held man alive, unscripted, pathless, within a hand of his station HOLD.dist ahead of Sam
// once held, never perceiving Sam and never barking, no hold while Sam is down / mid-takedown / on a wall, the choke only in the arm variant and the whip only
// in the gun one, the variant always what the hands say (drawn in slot 1 ⇔ gun), the pistol in the hand exactly when it is the gun variant and the knife's
// boxes in the fist exactly when it is the arm one (both once a hand-over has had its beat; no knife with nobody held), rounds past him never his and never
// closer than the cadence, nothing of a hold left on the animators once it is over, and — muzzle discipline (tune.muzzleDiscipline, on) — not one guard
