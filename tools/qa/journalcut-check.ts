// A checkpoint loaded off a card or the panel (Checkpoints.load / loadMem) and an encounter staged again between two frames (Game.restartEncounter: a card's
// restart) change the whole game, and a recording files only what a frame was given: a tape that ran on across one replayed as a break of the game's own.
//   (a) a file's load between frames stops the recording there — handed over through onStop with its reason, as many frames as were stepped — and that file
//       replays identically to its end; a new recording is asked for, begins on the loaded game, and ITS file replays too
//   (b) a restart between frames: the same
//   (c) a page-like recording (the HUD's bubble expiry after every update) cut on the very frame a bubble ran out: the closing digest was taken AFTER the HUD's
//       write, the file says so (meta.between) and replays; the same file with that word struck does NOT (the scene is the one the word exists for). An
//       immediate stop between frames says the word too
//   (d) inside an update nothing is cut (what changes the game there is the frame's own input), and with nothing changed a recording runs to its own stop
//   (e) a save kept IN MEMORY (a unit on the floor), written while the tape ran, loaded between frames: the recording is cut there, and the sensors are
//       live (their stream is the host's — sensors.ts SensorStream — and no snapshot puts it back)
// A load INSIDE an update is the other half: tools/qa/journalload-check.ts.
// The break word makes cut() do nothing: the tape runs on across the change, and (a) (b) (c) (e) must fail.
