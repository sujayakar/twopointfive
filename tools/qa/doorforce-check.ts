// man hears is real: footfalls filed where the player stands at the level his own walk files them, through the hearing model and the shut leaf. His rounds
// are real rounds (combat.ts fireWeapon), his boot the door's own kickIn. The check sets the rule, rounds through thin things (wallpen.ts) and the door
// splinter rule (doorblast.ts DOORSHOT) itself on either stand, and puts them back.
