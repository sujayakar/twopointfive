// under questioning ('…we all carry one, mine's on my belt' — dialogue.ts intel kind 'door') gives his KEY up with it — game.ts interrogate → player.ts takeKey:
// Player.keys gains what Guard.keys held (the floor key every man on nights carries), the clack of it at his hip, one for the debrief, Sam's word on it over Sam
// as the man's line ends (a 'key' remark: nobody answers, no stage moves, and like every line of his it is never cut) — and from then on the keyed doors treat
// Sam as they treat the staff: on the corridor face a tap of Space turns the key and pushes it open (a small clack + the creak, nothing loud, no pick, no kick),
// a hold eases key and leaf round in silence, walking into it pushes it, and the closer springs the bolt again behind him (where doors stay where they are left — DOORSTAY, the page — his own hand pulling it to does). The control cases: the same door
// without the key still demands the pick / the kick / walls him off; a second man 'giving' a key Sam already has changes nothing; the cubicle man (no keyed
// door on his beat) never offers one, nor does a man whose belt is already empty; a restart empties Sam's pocket and refills theirs; the sandbox's bare
// exchange (no hold) takes the key too, wordlessly. Staged and driven like grab-probes / dialogue-probes: the full game headless, the real inputs.
