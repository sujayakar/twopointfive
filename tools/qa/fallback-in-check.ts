// A MAN WHO LEAVES A LOST ROOM STAYS IN THE BUILDING — the check behind roomfight.ts `ROOMFIGHT.fallBackIn`.
// The fault it holds shut: a defender who gives his room up goes out by a door nothing has come at and holds it from the far side. For the warehouse's dock
// that door was dock_s, whose far side is the lot: he was planted out there and held the building from outside it (2 of 48 runs with a searching commander).
//   bun run tools/qa/fallback-in-check.ts [--scn warehouse-four] [--level levels/warehouse.json] [--seeds 3,7 | 1-12] [--want 2] [--upto 24 | 48 with --off] [--cap 100] [--off]
// What it does: plays each seed as the page ships it with the commander who searches (tools/qa/ships.ts --trace, PT_SEARCH=1, PT_NOTES=1) and reads every
// `falls back through <door> to <x>,<z>` note: the spot he was sent to hold the door from. Read against the level FILE (not the game's own test), that spot
// must not be out of the building: outside the rectangle round the structure's rooms (scenarios.roomClear.rooms' bounds) with no roof slab over it (a box
// at least 2 m across whose underside is 2.5 m up or more).
//   --level  the level file, when the scenario's name is not its file's (compound-four → levels/compound.json is found; the office's scenarios have no
//            structure in a file and cannot be asked here)
//   --off   plays with the rule off (`--set '{"ROOMFIGHT":{"fallBackIn":false}}'`): the fault as it was — expected to FAIL (exit 1), the proof that it can
// The seeds: NONE ARE NAMED. Which deals hold a fall-back moves with every change to the fight (the four once named here — 1, 26, 40, 42 — stopped holding
// one, and the check then looked at nothing), so with no --seeds it FINDS its own, as haulhome-check.ts does: seeds 1, 2, 3 … three at a time until `--want`
// men have fallen back through a door (under --off: until one has fallen back out of the building), `--upto` seeds at the most. The seeds that held one are
// printed, so a rerun can name them. --seeds plays exactly those and nothing else. (When this was written the search stopped at seed 15 with the rule on —
// fall-backs in 6 and 14 — and at seed 36 with it off: Tango 8 out through dock_n to the lot in seed 35, where the rule on keeps both of that run's fall-backs
// inside. Off, the fault is rarer than a fall-back, hence the longer reach.)
// exit 0 = somebody fell back and nobody fell back out of the building · 1 = somebody did, a run errored, or nobody fell back at all (NO VERDICT) · 2 = bad flags
