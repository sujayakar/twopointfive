// THE BIG SLOT (src/game/kit.ts BIGSLOT — every card has ONE big slot beside its pouches: the wall charge, the breaching shotgun, the dynamic
// hammer; src/game/bigkit.ts — the last two on a locked door: yours a row in the boot's place, a teammate's on a door order), headless:
//   bun run tools/qa/bigslot-check.ts [card|off|you|mate|shut|moves|weight|wiring]      (BIGKIT_BREAK=1 = the tools do nothing to a lock: every 'the lock is gone' line must fail)
// The maintainer, 10-14: "you have a single big slot on the bottom that can fit larger kit items and then smaller pouches for other stuff" · "i do think we
// should change the breaching shotgun to not take up a primary weapon slot" · "and then we should also add a dynamic hammer".
//   card    the switch on: one 'big' row a card, the weapon row a rifle or a pistol, no wall charge row; no step of the row puts two big
//           things on a man; a stored shotgun-as-gun card is read as the issued gun with the shotgun in the big slot; a stored card with two big things comes
//           down to one (the wall charge before a hammer) and says so; a hand that still sets 'walls' or the shotgun as a gun is
//           answered through the big row; the issued kit and every squad kit of the table are legal; a big thing fills the slot and no pouch; a table
//           from before the big slot marks the three big things by default. The switch off: a teammate's rows are the build before's, the weapon row
//           offers the shotgun, and a stored `big` is kept, inert
//   off     the switch off: a hammer forced onto the Player gets no row at a locked door, a staged man whose card says hammer carries none, and the
//           room clear's manager door under open and clear is the same run by digest with the cards' big slots filled as with them empty
//   you     the plain night's locked storage door, the tool put on you off your card. The shotgun and the hammer each, from the face the leaf opens away
//           from and from the face it opens toward (where the frame holds a boot): the row stands in the boot's place, and inside three seconds the lock is
//           gone — the shotgun's as gunfire, the hammer's with no shot: ONE blow where a boot would do, BIGSLOT.swings where the frame holds one, and
//           through that beat the HUD never says 'the frame took the boot' (a bare boot there does); from the face it opens toward the leaf stays home
//           and a hand opens it. A wedged door gives to the hammer and offers the shotgun nothing; a steel door offers neither
//   mate    the room clear's manager door under open and clear. A man whose card carries the shotgun keeps his rifle, brings the M870 up for the lock and
//           has his own gun back the moment it is off — and at once when the order is taken away or he is given another with it up. A man whose card
//           carries the hammer takes the lock in one blow and no shot. And a door locked on the face it opens toward, wedged (no pick opens it):
//           refused as ever without a tool, taken by the hammer in BIGSLOT.swings blows and pulled by hand — but refused to a SILENT squad, hammer or
//           no; the shotgun takes a keyed lock from that face the same way
//   shut    BIGSLOT.shut + BIGSLOT.beside (the maintainer after playing, 10-15: "i don't see how to use breaching shotgun or dynamic hammer" · "these
//           things should work for unlocked doors too" · "helps also not be directly in front of the door when opening" · "hammer should also help with
//           barricaded doors"). YOU at a door that is NOT locked: its own rows stand and the tool's row is listed under them; performed, it is worked from
//           beside the latch jamb, the latch is broken and the door ENDS OPEN from either face with no second press; a wedged door gives to the hammer
//           from the face it opens toward too. A TEAMMATE: the squad's own row on a door's tools — on H, shown on the door's first page, X then H —
//           takes an unlocked door with the tool from either face and ends (no second trip to the lock), takes a locked one without the halt at a door
//           found shut, is refused to a silent squad, and is not there when nobody carries one; a plain open and clear on an unlocked door still uses
//           the handle. Both knobs off: the build of 10-14 (no row at an unlocked door, the leaf left home from the face it opens toward, in front)
//   moves   BIGSLOT.moves (the maintainer, 10-15 evening, with Door Kickers 2 footage: "using the hammer shouldn't require being directly in front of the
//           door?" · "they put away their gun, equip the hammer, wind up, and then hit the door in one motion"). YOU, from where a stack's second man
//           stands (outside the hand's reach): the row is there, he WALKS to a place beside the frame and is never in the opening; a man on the latch
//           jamb leaves him the place off that man's shoulder, or the hinge jamb when he came from that side and the leaf opens away; the animator is
//           told each blow a wind-up ahead and it lands when told; the shotgun's place is a hand from the lock. A TEAMMATE's hammer is off his back
//           as he is sent and back on it after; both tools from hard by the frame. Off: the build of 10-15 morning. OVER THE RIFLE: with his rifle slung
//           across his back neither tool's boxes lie inside the rifle's (box against box, on this stand's body and rifle, and in the game's own frame);
//           with the rifle in his hands the tool lies on his back with no clearance. Looks at no picture
//   wiring  the two stands' row and word, the knob registry, the journal's tables (a recording from before the table replays with the switch off), slots.json
// Run it on both stands (plain, and TPS_PROFILE=shipped): it raises the switch itself, and says which stand it ran on. Where a verdict needs a state no
// level of the repo has (a lock keyed to the face a leaf opens toward, a wedge under a leaf, the frame rule on the frozen stand) the check sets it by hand
// and the verdict's line says so. Nothing here looks at a picture: neither tool has ever been seen on a GPU.
