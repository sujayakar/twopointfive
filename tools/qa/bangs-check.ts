// in the page, ?banginto=0; off on the frozen stand, TPS_BANGINTO=1) — and the stand, journal and boot lines of DOORTOOLS.wordNoCan (the word at a door
// held from outside spends no can: ?wordnocan=0, TPS_WORDNOCAN=1; what the word then DOES is asked in `probes.ts threshold-hold`, WORDNOCAN_BREAK=1 there).
//   bun run tools/qa/bangs-check.ts        (also `probes.ts bangs`)
// The maintainer's own case (10-16, with a tape of it: "with bang and clear for a door, they often don't really throw the flash bang into the room"): on
// his tape the thrower stood two metres down the wall, the can appeared in the door frame and went off in the air 1.75 m inside a third of a second later.
// Staged on the block, the squad of four set down outside a shut door, anybody who sees the stack taken off the floor, 'bang and clear' given:
//   (1) the stand: each switch as the stand says, and FROZEN_HOLDS carries its row and word;
//   (2) the rule off, a door with a deep room behind it: the can first shows more than a metre from the man who threw it and goes off inside two metres of
//       the frame — the fault as he met it;
//   (3) the rule on, the same door: the can first shows at the thrower's own hand, is passed to the door's edge, and goes off chest high a metre or more
//       deeper than it did, inside the room, where the toss said it would; nobody of ours is dazzled;
//   (4) the rule on, a second door: thrown into the room there too (1.5 m or more inside, at the point named), from the hand;
//   (5) the pair given the order, a third man of the team standing in the room where their can went: it is still thrown, and not to a point that would blind him;
//   (6) recordings from before each key replay with it off; the page's boot: no flag = on, ?banginto=0 / ?wordnocan=0 = off.
// BANGINTO_BREAK=1 = the switch left off where the lines want it on: they are asked all the same and must fail on what they find.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// Headless: lines are the collision's own. Never seen on a GPU; nobody has played it.
