// 'footfall' — ONE FOOTFALL A STEP (FOOTFALL.once, src/game/player.ts). A footfall is filed when the walk cycle crosses its half or turns over. The cycle runs
// backwards while he backpedals, and backpedalling is decided from where he aims against where he goes: with the cursor at his own feet that flips frame by
// frame, the cycle rocks over one edge, and every frame of it filed a footfall (seven running in a scripted creep up to a man's back: seven crouched steps in
// a tenth of a second to the man's ears).
//   bun run tools/qa/footfall-check.ts        (also `probes.ts footfall`; run it on BOTH stands: TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the second)
//   rock      crouched on the lobby's open floor, walking, and from the frame a footfall is filed the forward key and the back key by turns, a frame each,
//             for a third of a second (a scripted player hunting its mark; the drag's facing rule has no slack either). Key down: a footfall on five or
//             more frames running (the flaw). Key up: two at the most in that third of a second and no two of the whole run on frames next to each
//             other. On three seeds (the cycle starts each at another place).
//   walk      the same floor walked plainly — crouched, standing, sprinting, and backwards — for four seconds each, on three seeds: the key up files the
//             footfalls the key down does, frame for frame and level for level, and the two runs digest the same.
//   slow      the rocking kept up for ten seconds with legs of 2, 4 and 10 frames: the key up never files two footfalls nearer than a quarter of the
//             cycle, and no more than twice what a plain walk of the same ten seconds files (the legs ARE moving: it is not silence).
//   turns     what a first cut of the rule got wrong (it swallowed any edge crossed twice, however far he had been in between, and a pacing man walked
//             silent): forwards and backwards by turns of 30 and 50 frames, and a steady walk with the cursor put in front of him and behind him every
//             15, 25 and 35 frames — the key up files at least six in ten of what the key down does (its footfalls on frames running counted once).
//             What it loses are about-turns made within an eighth of the cycle of an edge.
//   held      the second place a footfall is filed, a man walked in the arm: the same rocking, the same two verdicts.
//   ears      a calm man a stride in front of EIGHT frames of rocking (the flaw as it was met: seven), his back to it: his awareness peaks higher with
//             the key down than with it up.
//   harness   the key is a row of the two stands' list with its word, off on the frozen stand and on in the page (`?footfallonce=0` puts it off), rides a
//             recording's tables, a recording from before it replays with it off, and a checkpoint carries the travel only once the key has been on.
// FOOTFALL_BREAK=1 = the key left down where `rock`, `held` and `ears` ask for it up: each must FAIL.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
//
// A FOOTFALL THE LEGS OWE (FOOTFALL.owed, the card's second key, UNDER the first: every arm above has it up wherever the first key is up, as the page has
// them). A cycle turned about again and again rocks between the edges or crosses one with too little travel behind it, and the first key alone lets a
// shaken walk go on a third to two thirds of a plain walk's footfalls.
//   shake     the forward key held and the cursor put in front of him and behind him by turns of 10, 12 and 15 frames for ten seconds, crouched and standing
//             (the 10 on three seeds). The first key alone: nine in ten of a plain walk's footfalls or fewer on every row, seven in ten or fewer at 10
//             frames. Both up: 85 in 100 of a plain walk's or more, no more than a third over, never two nearer than 12 frames. First key down: the
//             second changes nothing.
//   walk 2    the steady gaits, the sprint put on and off, the crouch taken and left under way and walks with stops in them, on three
//             seeds (six seconds each): the second key up files what it does down, frame for frame, and the runs digest the same. Then what it costs a walk with the cycle
//             turned about in it (a square, the cursor swept once round him, a walk begun backwards): the same footfalls or one or two more.
//   feet      one about-turn in a steady walk, begun at nine places in the cycle on two seeds: from two seconds after it every footfall is back on the
//             frame a foot comes down (a first cut of this key kept filing a fifth of a turn early for the rest of the walk).
//   nudge     a walk let go at eleven places in the cycle, four seconds stood, the key for a fifth of a second: nothing the key down does not file (a
//             first cut paid a debt from before the stop a few frames into the nudge). And a beat that roots him without asking the footfall test
//             (a takedown's, begun with a debt on the legs and the key held through it): the debt is not carried through it.
//   held 2    a man walked steadily in the arm: the second key files what the first alone does.
//   harness 2 the second key's rows on the two stands, its word (TPS_FOOTOWED=1), a recording with it, with the first key only and from before both, the
//             page's `?footfallowed=0`, and a checkpoint that does not carry `stepOwed` (a load is a standing start).
// FOOTOWED_BREAK=1 = the second key left down where `shake` asks for it up: its 'both keys up' line must FAIL.
