// THE PLAY-THROUGH AS THE BUILD SHIPS — tools/qa/playthrough.ts stood up the way the PAGE stands the game, not the way the harness does. The harness holds the
// newer rules off so every frozen digest still means what it meant; a mission judged for a player has to be played with them on. This wrapper runs the
// play-through under THE SHIPPED PROFILE (src/host/profile.ts: TPS_PROFILE=shipped — none of the harness's pins, the rows the page's boot writes, the cast), which
// `node tools/qa/shipped-page.cjs` holds equal to the real page switch for switch, and passes everything else through.
// Still NOT the page: Sam is the scripted commander (god mode, unseen, never fires), the engine is JavaScriptCore not V8, there is no GPU light meter (headless
// light skips the moon) and no smoke sight lines, and nothing a machine has kept (localStorage) is in it.
//   bun run tools/qa/ships.ts [--hard] [--weather rain|downpour|fog|dust] [--callout] [--noplaces] [--base | --partial] <any playthrough.ts flags>
//     --hard      DIFFICULTY.level hard          --weather K   WEATHER.kind (the page's ?weather=)        --callout   the last defenders' radio check
//     --base      the harness's own (frozen) stand, nothing set: the comparison arm
//     --partial   this wrapper as it was before the shared profile — GLASSFX=on TPS_MOVES=1 TPS_TURN=1 TPS_CAST=1 and the defenders' frags, nothing else: the stand
//                 every tally made with ships.ts up to the one build 527a92a was run on (it left the pouches rule, the destruction switch, the door walk, the
//                 night's opening, the silent net, the silent order, Sam's aim rows and the defender squads' radio check off)
//                 THE CHECKS THAT CALL THIS FILE PASS --partial (barracks-check, brace-room-check, callout-place-check, fallback-in-check, level-names-check,
//                 records-front-check (other-door-check plays the shipped stand now: its bar was read there); kit-cells.ts sets the same rows itself): their bounds were read on that stand. Each drops the flag
//                 once its bound has been read again under the profile.
//   env passes through: PT_HOUR=midday, PT_SEARCH=1, PT_SQUAD=2, PT_MORTAL=1 … (playthrough.ts's head lists them); a pin's own word still holds under the profile
//   (TPS_MOVES=0 bun run tools/qa/ships.ts = as shipped but for the movement pass)
//   exit code = playthrough.ts's
