// A TAKEN ROOM'S OTHER DOOR IS WATCHED — the check behind doortools.ts `DOORTOOLS.otherDoorM` (the men an entry leaves in a room: one of them has the
// room's other door).
// The fault it holds shut: a bang / open and clear put every man on his corners, the floor and then a sector across the room he had just searched; the
// room's OTHER door was nobody's. The warehouse's front office (door `off`, from the manager's office) and the compound's garage (door `g_e`, from the
// yard) each lost two men in a tenth of a second to one defender who walked up to that door and opened it on their backs.
//   bun run tools/qa/other-door-check.ts [--scn warehouse-four,compound-four] [--seeds 1-12] [--cap 420] [--jobs 4] [--pair 1,2,3,4,5,6] [--off]
//                                        [--on-json a.json,b.json --off-json c.json,d.json]
// What it does: plays each scenario × seed TWICE through tools/qa/ships.ts --json (the stand that file plays with no flag: the shipped profile where it
// has one) — the rule as shipped, and the rule at 0 — and reads two things.
// THE DOORS (playthrough.ts RunOut.other): of the other doors of every room taken and held that nobody of the squad had been beyond, how many had a gun on
// them by somebody's ORDER (or cover job) a second after the entry ended, and how many the rule dealt a man to.
// THE DEATHS (Death.other): a man who dropped IN A ROOM HIS OWN ENTRY HAD TAKEN (he had crossed its frame on that order), to a round that came through
// ANOTHER door of that room — or to a man who had walked in by one in the eight seconds before — where, a second before he dropped, no living teammate's
// order had a gun on that door (where the order points the gun, read off the game's own assignments ten times a second — not where a fight had swung it).
// Each such death with the rule is listed with what it was:
//   · the room's          he was still on the entry's own order (in it, or holding the room after it): what the rule is for
//   · · been beyond       … and by the death's own row the round did not come from floor nobody had stood on beyond THAT door: a door the squad has
//                         been beyond is one the rule leaves alone by design (a defender had since walked onto that floor). Listed apart, counted
//                         with the room's
//   · moved on            any later order (fall in, a stack on the next door, a hold, a wall charge) had taken him off the entry's: the watch ends with
//                         the order, by design. Listed, never counted — and under the scripted commander, who calls fall in ten to thirteen seconds
//                         after the men cross, MOST deaths through the compound's `g_e` are of this kind (men under 'fall in' still standing in the room)
// THE BAR IS A RATE AGAINST THE RULE AT 0, not zero deaths: the rule cuts these deaths, it does not end them, and which seed shows one moves with any
// change to the game (three fixed seeds at zero tolerance went red 900 commits after they were picked: two men lost after a later order had taken the
// watch, one through a door the squad had been beyond — none the fault). What is barred on is what the rule
// DOES — is the door watched — because that shows in every run; the deaths are its consequence, and on a build where the team loses few men that way
// even with the rule at 0 a dozen seeds show too few of them to bar on. Per scenario it FAILS when
//   · the rule deals a man to fewer than a QUARTER of such doors (it is not running, or mostly not), or the rule at 0 deals any (the switch did not
//     reach the game)
//   · the share of such doors with a gun on them a second after the entry is not at least FIVE POINTS higher with the rule than at 0
// and over the scenarios together it FAILS when the room's deaths (above) with the rule are more than those at 0 plus two: the rule making it worse.
// WHAT THE BAR DOES NOT READ, and the PASS line says so in numbers: whether the watch SAVES the man. Both bars read what the rule writes (the order's
// watch point); a watcher who does no good moves a death from 'nobody's door' to 'somebody's'. The rows print every death through a taken room's other
// door, whoever's it was, for both arms — read those, over a long count (--on-json / --off-json), for the outcome. Nor does it read whether the watch is
// KEPT after that one look a second in, nor the two doors the fault was found on by name.
// (Where the bar was read, windows of 12 seeds: the tree the rule was built on, 144 seeds a map — the share 7 to 36 points higher on the warehouse, 19 and
//  up on the compound, dealt 53 % of such doors at the least, the room's deaths 20 against 168 and 1 against 5; the build at c3fa7069 under the shipped
//  profile, 48 seeds a map — numbers and files in rebuild/missions/fixes/other-door.md in the project files. Fewer than 12 seeds a map is seed luck:
//  on the first tree's runs a random 6 seeds fail a bar about one time in thirty-five, 12 about one in three hundred.)
// THE PAIR STAGING (after the play-throughs, in this process): an entry of TWO keeps both its guns on the room until its floor is looked over. The office's
// break room behind a charge on its west door, a floor already alerted (doortools-probes.ts's own rig, the first-man probe's staging), each seed twice — the
// rule as shipped and the rule at 0. It FAILS when a man of the pair is dealt a door before the entry's 'in' (the fault as first built: the first man through,
// turned to the north door a second after he crossed, was shot by a man of the room the charge had only stunned), when more first men are lost with the rule
// than without it up to six seconds after the entry ended (that part reads the doors dealt AT 'in': before it the two arms are the same game), when the rule at 0
// deals anything, when a seed gives no entry, or when no door of that room is dealt after 'in' at all (the staging looked at nothing). `--pair 1,2,3` picks its
// seeds (a comma list, no ranges), `--pair 0` skips it — and the PASS line then says so.
//   --off      the red path: the arm at 0 is read as the rule's arm too (the rule against itself). The check is expected to FAIL (exit 1) on the two
//              per-scenario bars — nothing dealt, the share no higher — which is the proof that it can; failing for any other reason is said apart
//   --on-json / --off-json   read earlier play-throughs (ships.ts --json files, comma lists; both wanted) instead of playing: a long count read against
//              the same bar. Only seeds present in BOTH arms of a scenario are read (a seed twice in an arm: its last row); `--seeds` beside them
//              picks among those, and the head line says how many of the seeds asked for were there
// exit 0 = every bar above held on every scenario asked for · 1 = a bar failed, a run errored, or a scenario took no room with another door nobody had
// been beyond (NO VERDICT: the check looked at nothing) · 2 = bad flags, a file that cannot be read. A run that STALLED (the scripted commander stuck: the
// play-through's own red) is read like any other and counted on its scenario's row — it is not this check's to fail
