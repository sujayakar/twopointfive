// The 'threshold' family (game/doortools.ts — kind 'threshold': a room worked from the threshold before anybody goes in), run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts threshold | threshold-pair | threshold-four | threshold-hold | threshold-first | threshold-doors | threshold-leaf | threshold-last | threshold-hand | threshold-play | threshold-identity
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless. Every probe here gives the stage the way a console would (its rows on the door menu are thresholdmenu-probes.ts's) —
// `game.doorTools.thresholdOn(<door name>, 'all')` — on a start-card scenario staged exactly as the page stages it (scenarioList.ts → scenarioRun.ts).
// The harness has no light meter (what a man sees of another is guards.ts's direct-light estimate), no smoke, no picture: nothing here says how it LOOKS.
//   threshold-pair      the pair (the records office, and the office's room clear), a held room's door, three seeds each: the order is taken; when the leaf
//                       moves a man stands on each jamb, outside; the stage's phases come in order — stacked → threshold → held → (toss → bang →) step in →
//                       first man over the line → hand-over → searched → in; NO man of the order is over the frame line, nor on the room's floor, on any frame
//                       before 'step in'; rounds are fired at the room's men from outside it; the blind pockets get a can from a man who is not the first man
//                       in, bursting inside the room, before anybody crosses; every point stepped in to is 2.5 m or less inside; and the order ends as any
//                       entry does — the floor looked over by the entry's own search, the men left holding the room
//   threshold-four      the same with the squad of four (the depot, and the office's four-man room clear) — and the two men who are on neither jamb are outside
//                       with their eyes spare for the squad's back (orders.ts Assignment.spare) for as long as the room is worked
//   threshold-hold      the OTHER order of it — work the room from the threshold and HOLD the jambs until told (thresholdOn(door, who, side, true)) — with the
//                       pair (the records office) and the four (the depot): the door gone quiet, the lead says so and NOBODY goes in, no can is spent, for
//                       ten seconds past the moment the plain order would have gone; then each thing Sam can say, in a run of its own — step in
//                       (thresholdTell('step'): in with no can), bang and step in ('bang': a can bursts inside before anybody crosses), leave it ('leave': the
//                       order over, nobody ever inside, the kit as it was), the word from code (doorTools.go) and the word on its key (F, one frame); a
//                       follow-up that cannot be done is refused in words; and the four on two doors of one room — blue holding a threshold, red on a
//                       plain stack — cross together on one word, behind the last burst
//   threshold-first     DOORTOOLS.thrFirst — the floor gone loud in the team's ears (the stager's fight.hotT): the leaf opened from the jamb, the first of the
//                       stage's cans in, its burst let run dry, and only then the jamb men out onto their diagonals; the switch's three positions
//                       (the second can for a pocket the first left dark is asked without DOORTOOLS.outsidePlain; on a stand that has that rule — the
//                       shipped one — a line more: one can a door at that same door, on the word too)
//   threshold-doors     every door of the levels the seven scenarios play on, both faces: wherever the stack's own test passes (floor at a jamb), the stage
//                       has somewhere shallow to step in to (2.5 m or less inside); the count of faces with a man on EACH jamb and with one jamb only is printed
//   threshold-leaf      DOORTOOLS.thrDoorsLeaf: a man left on another door of the room is not put where that door's own leaf, stood open, hides it from
//                       him — the depot, rule off beside rule on, three seeds (THRDOORSLEAF_BREAK=1: red)
//   threshold-hand      DOORTOOLS.thrHand — a threshold held, every man put off the door from a second before Sam says 'bang, then step in' until a second
//                       after (what a grenade by the stack does to them): with the rule the can waits for a man back at the door — not the lead — and no
//                       longer than thrHandWait in all, past which it goes as it did, from the same man; without it the can leaves a doorway nobody
//                       stands at; nobody put off, the rule changes no beat; a recording from before the key replays with it off. THRHAND_BREAK=1 must fail
//   threshold-play      the scripted commander of playthrough.ts with PT_TOOL=threshold — every held room of all seven scenarios worked from the threshold
//                       instead of banged (the two rescues' F is their own drill: they run as ever) — one seed each: no run throws, none stalls
//   threshold-last      DOORTOOLS.thrLast (the captor's last warning heard at the door): the registry's hostage door staged by hand — the stack goes
//                       without a man still walking up (the far-jamb man: given the lead's wall, never across the door; the lead: the door handed to
//                       the man on his jamb; Sam in the place: the next one), nothing held, one can; off: the stack waits — and the rescue played from
//                       the threshold on two seeds whose clock runs out at the door, with the rule and without: a man across before the clock's round,
//                       both hostages alive, nobody more lost than without it
//   threshold-identity  with the stage NOT ordered the game plays as it did at af55d89: playthrough.ts's digest of the whole game every half second
//                       (PT_DIGEST=1), seven scenarios × two seeds, against the words frozen from that commit (fixtures/threshold-identity.json; THRESHOLD_IDENTITY_WRITE='<why>' re-freezes them after a step that moves the levels' walls)
//                       — asked on the FROZEN stand only: under TPS_PROFILE=shipped it says so and checks nothing (the digests are the frozen stand's)
