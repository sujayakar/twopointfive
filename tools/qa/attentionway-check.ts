// 'attentionway' — A GUARD'S ATTENTION THREAD RUNS THE WAY HE WILL WALK (ATTENTION.way, attention.ts attentionWay, ui/attentionviz.ts threadPoints). The
// maintainer, off the stealth tutorial mission, of a dotted thread drawn from a man in a hut straight through its wall to a ring in the yard: "weird that the
// line here is a straight line, not a pathed one. i'd expected pathed from squad commands".
//   bun run tools/qa/attentionway-check.ts        (also `probes.ts attentionway`; run it on BOTH stands: TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the second)
//   straight  (the flaw, kept behind the key) on each level a man is found with a place a knock takes his attention to that the straight line from his feet
//             reaches only through blocked floor: with the key off the thread is exactly that line.
//   way       the key on, the same men: the thread starts at his feet, ends at the place, has corners, and no step of it is on blocked floor.
//   walk      he then walks it: until he is at the thing he is never a metre from the thread drawn when he set off, no thread drawn on the way is on
//             blocked floor past his next corner (the leg from his feet to that corner may clip the margin the nav grid keeps round one as he rounds
//             it: printed, not asked), and standing at the thing (only looking) the thread is the straight one.
//   source    where the thread comes from on that walk: on his own path it is his feet and then his next corner; with the nav grid asked all the way
//             (a stand-in for a man with no path of his own) the grid is asked once in half a second and the thread never grows by over 0.3 m in a
//             frame — no kink back to a corner he has passed.
//   pieces    the overlay's half-metre pieces of a way: off his feet by the head, short of the place by the ring, no piece over half a metre, every piece
//             on the way; nothing for a man all but at the ring.
//   picture   a run that asks for the way every frame digests as the same run that never asks; the key is on on both stands, and the page's boot writes it
//             (`?straightthread` = off).
// ATTENTIONWAY_BREAK=1 = the key left off where `way` asks for it on: way must FAIL.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU and no overlay: what is read is the list of points the overlay is handed and the pieces it cuts them into, not a drawn line.
