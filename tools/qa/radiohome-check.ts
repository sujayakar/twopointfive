// 'radiohome' — THE HANDLER'S RADIO ASIDES ARE THE OFFICE NIGHT'S (WORDS.radioHome, dialogue.ts radioLive). The maintainer, off the stealth tutorial mission:
// "the 'subtle was twenty years ago' text with the handler keeps popping up -- should be confined to just the office level". Her dry lines and his answers
// (the drive, the rack, the floor's lights, a body found) were written for the solo night at the office, and were said on every level a solo night ran on:
// a tutorial mission restarted at a checkpoint heard the same pair again each time.
//   bun run tools/qa/radiohome-check.ts        (also `probes.ts radiohome`; run it on BOTH stands: TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the second)
//   office    the office, the key up: the lights die and she says her line a beat later, he answers after it. Nothing is taken from the night it was written for.
//   away      three other levels (the stealth tutorial mission among them), the key up: the lights die, twelve seconds pass, and no line of hers or his is in
//             the strip; a beat asked for by hand is refused. The same levels with the key down: she speaks, as the build did.
//   harness   the key is a row of the two stands' list with its word, off on the frozen stand and on in the page (`?handlerall` puts it off), rides a
//             recording's tables, and a recording from before the key replays with it off.
// RADIOHOME_BREAK=1 = the key left down where `away` asks for it up: away must FAIL.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU and no overlay: what is read is the game's own message list, which the radio strip draws.
