// while) the choke is on, chokeLimp as he folds, whipThud as the pistol lands, shove on the release (and, quieter, when a round tears the man loose). Nothing can
// be heard headless: this records what WOULD have played (headless.ts W.audioLog — name, position, gain, game time), stages every beat of the hold through the
// real inputs (Space held / tapped / E on his row, as grab-probes and gunhold-probes do), and checks the log against the moment: the intended names exactly once,
// no per-frame repeats, the choke's grains ≤ 3 a second and none after Space comes up, every one of them placed on the pair at chest-to-head height with the
// gain player.ts means. What they SOUND like is tools/qa/audio-render.ts's business (and a human ear).
