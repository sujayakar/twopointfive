// A DEATH'S SUMMARY LINE IS TRUE — the check on the debrief's one-line summary (src/game/chronicle.ts summaryLine / badgesOf; the missions goal's fault S5a:
// a run on which a guard saw Sam and shot him read 'seen 1 · … · unseen by staff · went down' — the badge was about the CIVILIANS and named the staff).
//   bun run tools/qa/death-summary-check.ts [--seeds 1]
// What it does: plays solo-night.ts's walk plan with the night's opening off (TPS_OPENING=0: the quick death the fault was read on) and, for every run that
// ended DOWN (on this plan: a guard's round, fired by a man looking at him), reads the summary: it says 'went down', its 'seen' count is not 0, and none of its
// words says he was unseen ('never seen', 'unseen by staff').
// exit 0 = every such line is true · 1 = one is not, a run errored, or no run ended down (NO VERDICT: the check looked at nothing)
