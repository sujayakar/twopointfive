// The 'registry' family — the hostage rescue's own level (levels/registry.json ← tools/levels/registry.ts, its rescue in the file's `scenarios` block —
// rebuild/scenario-levels/contract.md), run through probes.ts, and the level's own TALLY:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts registry | registry-level | registry-stage | registry-doors | registry-walk | registry-run
//   bun run tools/qa/registry-probes.ts tally [--styles rush,rush-f,flow,safe,safe-quiet,safe-side,crawl] [--seeds 1-32] [--jobs 3] [--cap 150] [--json out.json] [--md]
//   bun run tools/qa/registry-probes.ts trace flow:3            one run in this process with its timeline printed
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts stood up on the level — standUp({ level })). No GPU: no light meter (the CPU estimate of the direct
// light stands in, as it does for the office's tally), no smoke, nothing seen drawn. What the level LOOKS like is untested here.
//   registry-level   the file is the generator's level (0 diffs), the validator and the lint are clean on it, it is inside the renderer's fixed sizes, the rescue's
//                   data sits on its floor (rescue.ts checkRescue, the route's own check included); the two lines to the room measured along the nav grid
//   registry-stage   the rescue boots on it: the pair, Sam, two hostages, the captor and the door man on the level's marks, every inside door shut but the copy room's hall door (it stands open), ONE roamer —
//                   in the copy room or the reading room by the scenario's own coin (both seen over the seeds); nobody fires and no clock runs while Sam stands
//   registry-doors   stack room for the pair on every shut door a line to the room takes: the two men ordered onto each, from the side it is taken from, get onto
//                   their marks — on floor, apart, out of the opening
//   registry-walk    Sam walks every room and both approaches with the pair following, then again with FOUR following: every space entered, every door
//                   passed, everybody with him at the end; stuck man-frames and the closest two men ever came, the pair beside the four
//   registry-run     the level's tally on a few seeds: every run ends on the scenario's own result (no stall, no exception), and the level can be finished —
//                   a run with both hostages out — by the gallery and by the stacks. The counts per style are printed; they are not judged here
// THE TALLY is tools/qa/rescue-tally.ts's scripted player (the same hands, eyes and rules: its `Run`) given this level's floor and seven ways to play it:
//   rush     Sam sprints the gallery, boots the registrar's door and goes in first; no order
//   rush-f   the office's walkover: F at once, Sam sprints to the gallery's end and stays out of the hall
//   flow     down the gallery at a run with a look through the reading room's glass. A man seen in there: the pair are sent in after him. Nobody seen: he is
//            behind the blind wall — bang and clear on the copy room's door. Then F, Sam at the gallery's end
//   safe     the long way: the lobby's south door and the sorting room's door are locked against Sam — booted (a second each, loud); round the stacks at a
//            run with the pair; F from the sorting room (the two-door go: one man on the side door, the other round by the stacks' hall door to the main door)
//   safe-quiet  the same with both locks picked (4.2 s each, quiet)
//   safe-side   safe (booted), but both men go through the side door on the door tools' bang and clear: nobody goes round to the main door
//   crawl    every room on the way in order — reading room, copy room, the hall — then F
// (and two more for a question each: flow-pass = flow's look with neither room cleared, flow-open = the copy room opened without a can.)
// One process a run (the scenario's knobs and the team's start are module state). Numbers order the styles against each other on game logic; a bot's reaction
// and dead-centre cursor are not a person's.
