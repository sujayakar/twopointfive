// LIVED-IN ROOMS: THE STACK FACES KEEP THEIR MARKS — the check lived-check.ts cannot make (it imports nothing of src/game, and holds only 1.1 m off a door's line).
//   bun run tools/qa/lived-stack-check.ts [scenario,scenario …] [--quiet] [--strict]        (default: 12 scenarios of src/scene/scenarioList.ts SCENARIOS; QA_SWEEP=all: every one)
// A stack on a door stands along the wall either side of it, up to 3 m off the frame, and in a small room along the next wall too. Furniture there does not stop
// the level playing: the order is REFUSED 'no room on that door' and the team goes round by another door, which no run file shows as a fault of the room.
// What it does: each scenario is staged twice, as the page ships it (TPS_PROFILE=shipped), with the rooms on (TPS_LIVED=1) and off (=0), each in a process of
// its own (the switch is read once, at the stand-up), and every door, both faces, is asked for the marks of a stack of 1 … n of the staged teammates
// (orders.ts stackPosts — the squad's own rule, nothing repeated here). Per scenario:
//   FAIL  a face that dealt a mark for each man, each on the floor, with the rooms OFF deals none, fewer, or one off the floor with them ON (the face and the
//         bare marks are printed: the furniture to move stands on or beside them)
//   PASS  no such face (printed beside, not judged: the faces refused either way — the level's own walls — and the faces whose marks MOVED, each with its
//         bare and its furnished marks; --quiet = their names only)
// A MOVED FACE IS NOT HARMLESS. Furniture near a mark makes the deal fall to another of its layers: every man still gets a mark, on the floor, but elsewhere, and
// the walk to it can be the long one. The barracks' wash-room rack stood by the last places of the file four men take for the first door of the played way in:
// nothing was lost, this check was green, and the first entry came 4.3 s late (19.5 s against 15.3 bare). So: hold the faces on the way to a level's first
// doors EQUAL to the bare ones (--strict = exit 1 on any moved face, for a level meant to have none), and where one is left moved, play the level both ways and
// compare the first entry's time (TPS_LIVED=1|0 tools/qa/ships.ts --scn <id> --seeds 1-2 --json f: runs[].entries[0].t0 is the same on every seed).
// A scenario the staged level has no teammates on, or no doors, is said and not judged. NOT JUDGED AT ALL: lived PROPS (a stool, a loose crate: no deal asks
// about a prop, a man shoves it aside — keep them off the marks by hand), a stack dealt in play with a leaf standing open or a man on a mark (doortools.ts
// dealStack's own cases), the walk TO the marks, a mark the bare level already deals somewhere a man cannot use (only the nav grid's blocked cells are asked,
// in both arms alike), the quiet missions' one partner, the lessons. An authored mark under furniture refuses the scenario's start: that is 'did not stage'.
// Lines are `- PASS — …` / `- FAIL — …` (tools/qa/gate.sh counts them); exit 0 = all pass · 1 = a face lost its marks, a stage threw, the two arms staged
// different teams, or (--strict) a face moved · 2 = bad usage.
