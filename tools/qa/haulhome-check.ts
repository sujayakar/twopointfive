// haulhome-check.ts — THE FURNITURE COMES HOME (src/game/digin.ts HAULHOME): a defender hauling furniture to a door was asked whether it had made it the
// frame he stopped at his stand, with the thing still a hand short and seconds of his haul clock unspent — and gave it up. On, he brings it the rest of
// the way while that clock runs.
//
//   bun run tools/qa/haulhome-check.ts [--seeds 1,2,…] [--trace]         (frozen stand; the default plays deals 1‥8 with the switch off and keeps those that show the fault)
//   TPS_PROFILE=shipped bun run tools/qa/haulhome-check.ts               (the page's stand)
//   HAULHOME_BREAK=1 …                                                    the 'on' arm played with the switch left off: must FAIL (exit 1)
//
// THE STAGING is the last stand on the compound (laststand-probes.ts's, as frameholds-probes.ts plays it): five on eleven, the team left on its start mark,
// the defenders taken down by hand to three, who are ordered into one room and dig in — a last stand wedges any door of its room. Its doors are hung to open
// INTO the room (a wedge holds only a door that opens toward the man) and close on their own (the stay-open switch, manners and off-the-hinges pinned off:
// what a man does about a door left standing open is DIGIN.shutOpen's ground, not this rule's). Each deal is played twice, the switch off and on — the check
// writes it itself after the game stands, so both stands ask the same thing.
//
// WHAT IT ASKS
//   1  off: on these deals a man gives his furniture up at the door ('the furniture did not make it to the door') — the staging does exercise the rule
//   2  on: he says he brings it the last of the way, and nobody gives furniture up on a deal where somebody did with it off
//   3  on: more doors end wedged over the deals than off, and no deal ends with fewer
//   4  a recording from before the key replays with it off; one that carries the key keeps its own word (journal.ts applyKnobs)
// NOT ASKED: what the hauled thing looks or sounds like on the page — never seen on a GPU, never heard.
