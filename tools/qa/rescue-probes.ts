// The 'rescue' family (game/rescue.ts — the HOSTAGE RESCUE playtest behind ?rescue / --rescue), run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts rescue | rescue-off | rescue-stage | rescue-clock | rescue-orders | rescue-set | rescue-tally | rescue-restart   [--verbose]
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts; the scenario started with game.rescue.start() exactly as main.ts's flag starts it, Sam's words given as
// one-frame F / X presses through the harness Input or by the same two methods the keys call). The harness has no light meter: Sam's visibility is planted dark
// and the AI men judge each other by guards.ts's direct-light estimate — what anybody SEES down that corridor at night is the harness's reading, not the page's.
// Sam is a statue at the lobby arch unless a probe moves him (teleports along the corridor): nothing here plays his part of the fight.
//   rescue-off      the flag off: nothing of it runs — inactive, no unit, no hostage, the shift and the civilians as ever, and F / X presses change nothing (ten
//                   seeded seconds digest the same with and without them)
//   rescue-stage    start(): the shift benched, the building's own civilians off the floor, two hostages down in the manager's office, the captor in it, the door
//                   man in the corridor, the roamer in the break room, the pair and Sam at the lobby arch, the hostage room's door shut, the side door unlocked,
//                   the budgets held; nothing moves and the clock does not start until Sam moves — then it does, and the pair fall in on him unasked
//   rescue-clock    CLOCK ONE with the spread at 0 and the team standing still: the three steps in order, the first hostage shot resolveSecs + aimSecs after the
//                   start, the second secondHostageSecs + aimSecs later, the run lost; the clock OFF: nobody is shot; a dazzled captor's clock stands still for
//                   the dazzle's length; a dead captor with nobody of his in the room: the clock stops and nobody is shot; a hostage hit by Sam's own round
//                   loses the run at once
//   rescue-orders   F with the clock running is bang and clear: the pair run the corridor and the door tools (the order menu's own bang and clear, given for Sam,
//                   one can out of the squad's three) take them at the door, stack → boot → can → bang → entry in order; the order menu's orders: the pair fall in
//                   unasked when the clock starts and trail Sam down the corridor past the conference room, never in it; the menu's hold, fall in again; a first
//                   order to one man still brings the other; a menu order takes them off F's entry on the way to the stack (the can comes back) AND with the boot
//                   going in (the door tools' rule — no 'committed'); the room called, they are posted; quiet start: F stacks and holds, F again goes, and the
//                   clock starts when the men inside hear the boot
//   (rescue-doortools  the menu's door orders on the rescue's doors, the charge, both doors on one F: rescuedoors-probes.ts)
//   rescue-set      CLOCK TWO: the same immediate assault against men who are never set before the bang (setSecs long) and men who always are (setSecs short) —
//                   no blind round from the unset, blind rounds from the set, and the team is through the door sooner on the unset room (it falls at least as often, for no more men); the roamer leaves his post once he is set, or sooner on the room fight's own rally; the captor never leaves the room
//   rescue-tally    THE CLOCK CHANGES THE OUTCOME: the default knobs over the same seeds with the order given at once, after 10 s and after 45 s of standing at
//                   the arch (the stand-in for time spent on rooms along the way), and after 45 s with the clock off — hostages alive in each
//   (rescue-flow-*  the pair's unasked covers, the openings' states and the two-door go: rescueflow-probes.ts)
//   rescue-restart  a restart under it stages it again (fresh cast, hostages alive, clock back to not started); stop() puts the shift, the building's civilians,
//                   the doors and the light count back and the floor runs on; a checkpoint load is refused while it is up

 *  rescue PLAYED as shipped, `tools/qa/ships.ts --scn hostage-rescue`, ends with both hostages alive). So such a probe names the rules its scene was staged without —
 *  by the rule's row in the stands' own list (src/host/profile.ts FROZEN_HOLDS), or 'glass' for the three glass parts — and they are held off for the WHOLE probe on
 *  either stand: nothing to do on the frozen one; on the shipped one the probe's last line says what was held, since its PASS there is then not the rule's. A rule
 *  whose own env word the run gives is left to that word, as on any stand. Each list is a set that turns its probe green on the shipped stand, found once by taking
 *  the shipped rules out by halves (single seeds: not the only such set, and nothing re-reads it — take a rule off a list and run the probe shipped to see):
 *    rescue-doortools      DOORWAY.oneWay · DOORTOOLS.testDoor ('stacked → the boot' is one order there) · DOORTOOLS.outsidePlain (the threshold rows its menu check asks for)
 *                          — and rounds stopping in glass for ONE scene of it, the captor's clock under the can (paneStops below: he is shot through the pane beside the door before the can goes off)
 *    rescue-flow-pass      DOORMANNERS.on (the nearer man 3.5 m from Sam)
 *    rescue-flow-states    DOORMANNERS.on · glass (the roamer behind the conference glazing is shot through the pane)
 *    rescue-flow-twodoor   DARKFOE.on ('F is a man short') · RESCUEEND.on (its room's two men are the whole cast: down, the run is won cleared before 'the men up are the menu's again' is read)
 *    rescue-clock          RESCUEEND.on (its last scenes stand in a room with every man of theirs down: under the rule that is a run already won, cleared)
 *    rescue-orders         DOORMANNERS.on · DARKFOE.on · RESCUEEND.on (it asks for the old end by name: the room held holdSecs)
 *    rescue-set            DOORMANNERS.on · glass · MOVES.gait (one part of the moves, the page under TPS_MOVES=1,gait=0. With glass held and the gait on, the untrained
 *                          stance lifts the captor's head a few degrees and — as traced on the moves' side — he sees the pair through the pane before the bang: the six-seed tally reads 4 of 6
 *                          rooms and 7 of 12 men where every bound was read at 6 of 6 and 12 of 12. Only in this staging — with nothing held the gait costs nothing) */
