// THE REPLAY'S CTRL TURN FOLLOWS THE VIEWER'S 'TURN DIRECTION' ROW (Options > Game; host/findme.ts FINDME.turn). In play the row is the sign on host/loop.ts's
// orbit; the engine replay (src/replay/engineplay.ts) turns its own picture under Ctrl — the mouse moved, or dragged — and says it turns "as Ctrl does in
// play", so it asks the same row. This holds:
//   · ctrlTurn(dx) is 0.006 rad a pixel the way it always was with the row as BUILT (the page's own start is the flipped way), and the other way with the row flipped,
//   · both Ctrl roads in the player's mouse code go through it (the mouse moved under Ctrl, and a drag begun under Ctrl, with Shift or without), and a right
//     or Shift drag with no Ctrl — the viewer's own turn-and-tilt, which play has no like of — does not. (Read off the source: the handlers pressed for real,
//     with the row flipped, are the page tool's `turn` section.)
// REPLAYTURN_BREAK=1 makes the replay's turn not ask the row: 'the other way with the row flipped' must fail.
//   bun run tools/qa/replayturn-check.ts          exit 0 = all pass · 1 = a line failed
// On the page: engine-replay-page.cjs `turn` (the row flipped) and `fog` (the row as built), both under `findtuned=0`. The row's own page check: findme-page.cjs.
