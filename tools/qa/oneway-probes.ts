// The 'oneway' family: EVERY DOOR OPENS ONE WAY (src/game/doors.ts DOORWAY, src/game/doorswing.ts; the maintainer, 10-08: "doors could use some work too. only open one
// direction"). Every door of every level a mission is played on (the office and each scenario's own level file), from BOTH faces, by every kind of opener — and
// after every step of every case the one invariant: the leaf's angle never leaves the side it opens into.
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts oneway | oneway-deal | oneway-read | oneway-leaf | oneway-player | oneway-men | oneway-save | oneway-off
// All headless; nothing here looks at a picture.
//   oneway-deal     the side every door was dealt and why (doorswing.ts): a door of a held room off a hall opens into the room, a drill plan's door the way its
//                   plan throws it, a keyed door away from its cylinder; the same deal on a second boot; the table printed
//   oneway-read     the read the sibling parts plan round (Doors.swingOf): hinge and handle a leaf apart, the leaf at every angle it can stand at inside its
//                   sweep, the mirrored floor on the far face outside it, pullFace = the face it opens into
//   oneway-leaf     the Doors themselves, every door × both faces × every opener: walked into (player; crouched; a keyed man = a teammate or a defender),
//                   run into (the player's sprint, an alert man's shoulder), used (Space: push / pull), eased, booted (kickIn), shoved by a drill's own write of
//                   Door.vel either way, slammed and pulled to, an angle written on the wrong side, a lock held against a keyless man. Each must OPEN (the man
//                   gets through / the leaf stands open) and never cross its frame
//                   (QA_FRAMEHOLDS=1 — doors.ts DOORWAY.frameHolds: the booted openers are split by face in the open; from the face it opens toward the
//                   leaf must stay home, its keep whole, a thud heard. The rule's own lines are the 'frameholds' family, frameholds-probes.ts)
//   oneway-player   the real player on his own feet (Game.update, the puppet's strings) through every door from both faces, and Space on its row from both
//   oneway-men      real men under the AI's own walk (a scripted goal: nav path, threadPath, their contacts): a teammate (operative) and a defender (hostile)
//                   through every door from both faces
//   oneway-save     a checkpoint made on double-acting leaves loaded on one-way doors: each leaf as wide on the side it opens into; a pull in hand survives a save
//   oneway-off      DOORWAY.oneWay off: the leaves double-acting as they were (pushed from either face they open away), the read still dealt
