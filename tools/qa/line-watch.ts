// A FRIEND IN THE LINE OF FIRE — a bystander for tools/qa/playthrough.ts (PT_LINE=1), like its Tally, DefWatch and ways-watch.ts: it reads, and writes nothing
// the game reads (no dice drawn, nothing ordered; with it on a run's PT_DIGEST is the run's without it).
// The question (rebuild/line-of-fire): how often does a teammate with a man to shoot have his round or his gun held for a friend standing in the line, for how
// long, who the friend is (the scripted commander, a mate, somebody else of his side — a hostage), what each of them was doing, and what it cost him.
//
// A BLOCKED FRAME, per living teammate who is not blinded, staggered or held:
//   his man     the hostile his muzzle is on (roomfight.ts Op.tgt) — or, for a man the fight AI has (no script), his foe — alive and IN HIS SIGHT this moment
//               (the room fight's own meter: a real sighting inside the last 0.3 s)
//   a round     there is a shot at that man past the level (guards.ts clearShot at his chest, else his head — the fire gate's own order): furniture, a jamb or
//               a pane in the line is somebody else's question and is not counted here
//   a friend    the game's own tests say one is in the line: the fire gate (roomfight.ts friendInLine, this frame's muzzle → the point the round would go to),
//               the carry (the same from the gun shoulder to his chest: what lowers the gun for the player), or the script runner's / the fight AI's muzzle
//               discipline (guards.ts colleagueInLine); a gun still down on the discipline's own 0.2 s after the line cleared stays counted to the same friend
// `engaged` = the first two; `blocked` = all three; `ready` = blocked AND past his reaction beat and not reloading (only a friend is keeping the round in).
// AN EPISODE = one teammate's blocked frames with no gap over GAP seconds. Each carries the split the page wants (seconds of it):
//   by whom              Sam (the commander) · a mate (an operative unit) · other (anybody else of his side: a hostage)
//   the commander        still (under 0.3 m/s) or moving; what the driver had him doing — 'post' (stood where his errand put him), 'walk' (walking his errand),
//                        'off' (stepping out of a man's fire: playthrough.ts offLine); and, stood at his post in the line, whether the driver's own rule saw
//                        him in it and had a free spot to step to (`samFree` — it should have moved him), saw him in it with a wall on both sides (`samBoxed`),
//                        or did not see him in it at all (`samUnseen`: the game's lane is wider than the driver's 0.9 m, or its line is another line)
//   the teammate         walking on an order (a script goal not arrived at: the side step's own exclusion — `walk`), on a step the room fight itself ordered
//                        (`step`: round a friend, off a doorway), planted but moving over 0.3 m/s (`drift`),
//                        or planted and still (`still`: the only case roomfight.ts sideStep works in); his order's name and the door order's phase at the start
//   what the game did    a side step round the friend (`stepOk`) and the let-go for a man shooting from elsewhere (`letGo`) — both read off the room
//                        fight's own notes —, a side-step try that found no spot (`stepNo`: it bars itself a second),
//                        feet held short in the dark for Sam (`short`), the fight AI's own line step (`aiStep`); seconds with the gun lowered (`low`)
//   the threat           seconds its muzzle was on him (inside 0.35 rad: the room fight's own `onUs`), seconds he was its foe; rounds that passed inside
//                        NEAR m of him while blocked and in the AFTER seconds after (`shotsAt`, and `shotsBy`: by the masked man himself)
//   the geometry         seconds the friend's body was really in the way (`tight`: inside 0.35 m of the muzzle → man line, between them) and seconds he stood
//                        PAST the man (`past`); the rest is the game's lane being wider than a body (0.45 m, to 0.95 for a man on the move)
//   another man          seconds he had another hostile in his sight with a round at him and no friend in THAT line (`alt`: he was held on a masked man
//                        with an open one to shoot)
//   what happened        `out`: 'ok' · 'killed' (while blocked) · 'killedAfter' (inside AFTER s of it); `by` the killer, `byThreat` it was the masked man;
//                        `end`: why the stretch ended — dead · threatDown · lostSight · noShot · letGo · switched · clear (the same man, the line open) ·
//                        blind · runEnd; metres he and the friend each moved over it; his rounds in the AFTER s after; whether the masked man was dropped
//                        inside that, and by whom
// A hit is a kill in this game (combat.ts: a round that finds a man drops him), so there is no 'hit, not killed'; `shotsAt` is the near-miss count.
// THE RUN'S OWN TOTALS (man-seconds): up · engaged · blocked (by Sam / mate / other) · ready; and every teammate's death filed as 'blocked' (a blocked frame
// inside GAP s before it), 'after' (inside AFTER s of one), 'engaged' (he had his man and an open line), 'none'.
