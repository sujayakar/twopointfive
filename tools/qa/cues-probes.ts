// The 'cues' family (game/cues.ts — the defenders' net on the radio strip, ranked and rate-limited, and a line for the decisions they took in silence), run
// through probes.ts:   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts cues | cues-lines | cues-strip | cues-run
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless. No picture and no sound here: 'drawn' is the strip's own row list (stripRows — what both HUDs draw), not a screen.
//   cues-lines   every new line of the table falls in the class it was written for, and the defenders' existing calls fall where the ranking puts them
//   cues-strip   the strip's rules on a bare clock: a unit's radio line gets a row; the same words twice, a class inside its gap, a full strip of better
//                rows and a class with its two rows are held back; a better class takes the worst row; a 'radio: ' row is always drawn
//   cues-run     the team met in the mess on levels/block-squads.json: no cue is ever written on a Guard, the net reaches the strip, silent decisions get
//                a line, Sam down is told to the floor, a place on the net is the level's own. CUESRUN_BREAK=1 = Sam's god mode is left on: must fail
// The rule is settled (CUES.on): no line asks the switch off and nothing here writes it (until 2026-11-07 cues-strip's last line and half of every line of
// cues-run asked the message ring as it was before the rule, and cues-run's first line held the run with the switch on to the run with it off).
