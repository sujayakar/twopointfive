// A DUMP OF KEPT REPLAYS, UNPACKED AND GONE THROUGH (src/replay/kept.ts — the page keeps every run by itself; a hosted build's backend holds them and tools/cloud/pull.ts
// writes them out as one such file. Until 2026-10-27 the page made that file itself, 'Hand over replays': those are read here as before):
//   bun run tools/qa/replay-dump.ts <dump.ndjson[.gz] | replay.json[.gz] | folder> … [--out DIR] [--moments N] [--again] [--quiet]
// Takes any mix of dumps and single replay files (F7's, the viewer's 'download with notes'), in any number, in any order, as often as they are sent:
//   · DE-DUPLICATED: a page visit is one tape however many dumps carry it (by its visit id and piece number: the fullest copy stands); a single file saved by the key
//     is a WINDOW of its visit — where the visit's own tape is here the file adds only its notes and 'F7 was pressed here'; single files of one visit with no kept
//     tape are held against each other by their step numbers, and one that lies inside another is dropped (its notes move over).
//   · each visit is written to --out as a NORMAL REPLAY FILE (<name>.json.gz): tools/qa/replay-at.ts, its --rerun and the /replay page read it as they read any other.
//   · each gets a list of MOMENTS WORTH A LOOK made with no note on it: page errors, restarts and loads, the player down, a teammate down (his order, and what took him
//     down IN THE TAPE'S OWN WORDS — "X down — Y's round", a blast by name and whose burst it was; only where the tape named nothing, the one round that ended
//     nearest him, marked inferred), a hostage down, the player stunned or blinded by a blast, orders refused, a run's END in the game's own line ('run ended'; a
//     restart after a WIN is 'played again'), a quiet mission's stages as one row with what the HUD said at each, the SQUAD's routing smells (a route and no
//     movement — 'stuck', or 'waited' where the man said why he stood or his order's row reads a wait; a mark that really jumps — never a defender, who stands
//     on purpose, and never one walk dealt its next corner), where F7 was pressed, and every note. The header's switches are the run tape's start flags and
//     each change with its moment, not the flags the file happened to end under. KNOWN: a wait is read off his words and his order's row; the game's own
//     reason for it (sneak.ts) is not in the trace.
//   · a single file unpacked on an earlier call is folded into its visit when the visit's own tape arrives later; --again goes through everything already in
//     --out with this build's reader (no input needed).
//   · --out/index.json remembers what earlier calls unpacked there (the next dump is held against it); --out/index.md is the table to read.
// A tape is DATA: nothing in one is run or followed; text from one is printed quoted. Reads kept.ts and format.ts alone — no game is stood up, any build's tape reads.
// EXIT 0 read · 1 nothing readable in what was given · 2 usage.
