// leave one honest set of holes in glass. All headless, on the real game stood up with the glass parts ON (each probe raises them by name and the stand-up of the
// next game puts them back), PASS / FAIL each with the numbers.
//   pellets-arm        the muzzle pressed through a pane (shoulder one side, muzzle the other): one shell files ONE crossing at the arm point — one blow in the
//                      fracture model, one hole remembered, one exit jet, one 'glass' event — and all nine pellets fly on from the muzzle (the man beyond drops);
//                      a laminated sheet across the arm takes the shell as one mark and lets nothing by
//   pellets-rule       one shell at a plain (annealed), a toughened (tempered) and a laminated pane from 1, 4 and 8 m, many shells each on a mended pane: every
//                      pellet that met the glass is in the shell's record, through or stopped; the record obeys the rule (a mark is never on another mark of
//                      its shell, a joiner always is); the fracture model was given exactly the marks, the holes and the jets exactly the marks that went
//                      through, one hearing event a pane a shell. A shell with pellets BOTH through and stopped in one pane (toughened glass raked at its
//                      limit) is held to the same rule. Prints the table the page quotes: what a shell does to each glass at each range
//   pellets-energy     GLASSPEN.energy.m870 is written down and means what the page says: one plain or toughened sheet square-on, never a second standing
//                      one, never laminated; other rows untouched; a man behind plain glass is dropped by a shell, a man behind the laminated sidelight is not
//   pellets-identity   glass parts off, a shell at each pane = the word frozen on 0ee0094; glass on and no shotgun in anybody's hands (rifle rounds through
//                      the same panes) = the word frozen on 0ee0094
//   pellets-red        the red paths: with the rule switched off (GLASSPEN.shellR 0) the arm check DOES go red (nine blows at one point); the record
//                      checker flags a doctored record; with the m870 entry taken out the energy check goes red
