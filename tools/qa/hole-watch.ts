// WHAT THE MEN DO WITH WHAT BROKE — a bystander for tools/qa/playthrough.ts (on whenever the destruction's switch is), like its Tally, DefWatch and WaysWatch: it
// reads the wall engine's change feed (wallbreak.ts `walls.since`) and the roster, and writes nothing the game reads (the digest is the same with it).
//   made      rows of the feed by kind and cause ('hole by blast', 'port by fire', 'cover by fire' …)
//   through   times a man of each side stepped onto floor a HOLE opened (a nav cell that was wall; once per man per 2 s — a man standing in it counts once),
//             and how many different men of each side did
//   killed    men of each side dropped by a round whose line (killer's feet → his, in plan) crosses something that was opened: through a hole, a port, or
//             where cover stood (the first of those it crosses) — 'shot through what broke'
//   react / walls / firstHole   wallreact.ts's and wallbreak.ts's own counters at the end, and the second the first hole was made
//   wallLog   wallcharge.ts's own log of its orders (set, stood off, blown, who took which point and door inside)
//   watch     blast holes and the team's guns, read four times a second: `open` = hole-seconds (each blown hole, from the blast to the end of the fight),
//             `held` = those with a living teammate's gun on it (a line from his chest to the gap's middle, his aim within 30 degrees of it, inside 14 m),
//             `near` = those with a living teammate within 6 m of it by a straight line — a hole with nobody near it is behind the team, not beside it
