// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts on levels/block-squads.json, started exactly as the page's scenario row starts it). No order is given
// to the team in any of them: what is under test is what each squad DOES with what it hears — how a whole clear goes is the scripted tally's
// (tools/qa/playthrough.ts --scn block-squads, whose RunOut carries every squad's timeline).
//   enemysquads-stage    the file's three squads stand as dealt (Alpha 3 in the mess, Bravo 5 in the workshop + store, Charlie 3 in comms), sixteen characters;
//                        SQUADS.on off, or a level with no squads block (records), stages none — and the seams answer 'not mine'
//   enemysquads-noise    surprise lost on open floor (one loud report where the team starts, nobody in contact): every squad says ONE thing on its net and
//                        gets on its doors, nobody is sent at the noise, and the first contact call is answered at once (SQUADS.openPair = the first cut) — not all of
//                        them out, not all of them at home when a way round exists
//   enemysquads-contact  the team met in one squad's room (Sam stood in the mess): Alpha calls it, Bravo answers inside its beat with men OUT (help or a
//                        pair round) and a man left in each of its rooms, Charlie locks down; the same staging with SQUADS.on off: no squad says anything
//   enemysquads-radiocheck  SQUADS.radioCheck (unseen drops are found by radio check or body): a man dropped silently where no mate can make the body out —
//                        off: his squad is in contact that frame (the rule as it was); on: nothing until he is asked for by name on the net, men WALK to
//                        his post, one of them has the body at his feet, THEN contact; a body in a mate's open view is contact by his eyes; a man taken
//                        from his post (held) is asked for, looked for, 'no sign', the men back at their posts and no call on the net; a loud drop is contact at once
