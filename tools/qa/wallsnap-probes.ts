// The 'wallsnap' family (through probes.ts: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts wallsnap`, or this file directly) — the wall hold's feel pass (src/game/wallsnap.ts,
// WALLSNAP.on; the harness's frozen stand holds it OFF, these turn it on):
//   wallsnap-take     the take runs its own clock (0.12‥0.30 s by distance and turn), moves on the frame of the key, the turn ahead of the glide, back and
//                     station arriving together; the feet stay planted in the world and step (they do not slide); nothing of him through the plaster
//   wallsnap-landing  the pelvis dips as the back lands and comes back; one scuff for the player's ears; NO step / noise event filed for the take
//   wallsnap-reach    walking AT a wall takes it from further off than standing does; walking PAST one does not; Q a moment early still takes it
//   wallsnap-off      Q with nothing held leaves him within a hand of where he stood; a direction held walks on at pace that frame; the stick held away
//                     lets go in a tenth of a second (a diagonal sidles; with alongDeg 0 it lets go in under a fifth, as it did); the pose is gone in ten frames; the pistol is back in the hand
//   wallsnap-stack    Q with the rifle in the hands keeps it there: 'stack' stance, low ready, facing along the wall, nothing through the plaster; walks
//                     along it; a click with a clear line fires that frame and shoulders the rifle; a click through the wall fires nothing
//   wallsnap-duo      two person stealth, the partner following: the take, the sidle back at him, off and on, the rifle stack and its step-out — the hold
//                     is never shoved or dropped, his order stays 'fall in', he is never inside Sam nor ahead of his muzzle
//   wallsnap-cover    parked at an open end, the cursor on a point the corner hides steps him out past the end with the rifle up, and back when it returns;
//                     no flutter with the cursor held on the threshold; a reload brings him in; E on the stack slings it and the hold becomes the back hold
//   wallsnap-camera   the camera turned any way (24 yaws × 8 key combinations): a stick within 55° of the wall's line sidles him and never drops him; only
//                     square-out lets go; into the wall does nothing. WALLSNAP_BREAK=1 = the rule before it (must fail)
//   wallsnap-kit      2 (or E with the rifle selected) on the back hold brings the rifle up into the stack without leaving the wall; another item chosen on the
//                     stack is the back hold again and says it waits for the step off; Q leaves with what he chose; 2 with the rifle up is the launcher's
//                     load (through the gun's setup when that is on) and he stays stacked
//   wallsnap-off-same with the switch OFF nothing of the hold carries a feel-pass field and the take is the old fixed 0.22 s glide
