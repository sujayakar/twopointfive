// HOW MANY ARE INSIDE IS A MYSTERY. The maintainer, 10-23: "we should also remove all defender counts from the
// menus, etc., it should be a mystery!" What a player reads BEFORE a mission, held to that: the words of
// every mission row, start-page pick and difficulty sentence. Reads tables only: no stand, nothing of the game runs.
//   bun run tools/qa/mystery-check.ts [--list]      (also `probes.ts mystery`, in families ui and words)
//   total    no row's place, job or pick line says its own head count: a number beside "enemies", "defenders", "guards", "men" … that IS the row's
//            `defenders`, any such number past five, "against eleven", "eleven hold". A smaller number is a part of the puzzle and stays ("two sentries
//            who watch each other"). The training and tutorial rows are lessons: their numbers are the exercise, listed and not judged
//   hard     the sentences that say what Hard is name no number of enemies
//   asks     no screen reads a row's `defenders` or the tally's roster for itself: nothing under src/ui names `.defenders` or `.roster`
// MYSTERY_BREAK=1 reads the old rows' and Hard's old sentences as theirs: 'total' and 'hard' must FAIL.
// The page's own half (the cells not drawn, the large map left by a click beside it): tools/qa/mystery-page.cjs.
