//   bun run tools/qa/filespread-check.ts [--verbose]      (probes.ts filespread, in family squadorders; FILESPREAD_BREAK=1 and FILEHOLD_BREAK=1 must FAIL)
// (probes.ts holds ORDERS.propRound off for this check, WAYS_AS_THEY_WERE: its stagings are by the ways the men walked before it. Run alone on the shipped
// stand: TPS_PROPROUND=0 in front.)
// Found by the wall charge's own check on block-squads: Sam put down at (13.6, 10.3) with no trail behind him and the four told to fall in, Blue One's and Blue
// Two's places came out at (11.69, 7.37) and (11.55, 7.16) — the file's places run straight back from Sam past the end of his trail and both stop where the
// floor does. With the doorway manners on (the page) the rear man is 'standing on a mate', so he is sent to his exact place, a quarter metre from the other's,
// and the two shove each other for as long as Sam stands there.
//   1. that staging, rule off: the fault is there (two men still moving after twenty seconds, their places within half a metre)
//   2. the same, rule on: every man still, no two places within the manners' 0.85 m and no two men within 0.6 m, everybody arrived, nobody further from Sam
//      than with the rule off + 1 m
//   3. Sam put down on the team's start and in up to four held rooms of four squad levels: the rule had work to do (places on one spot without it, places
//      dealt again with it), with it never more men moving than without, no two places on one spot, nobody 1.5 m further from Sam than without it or than the
//      file's own places reach in that run (depot-four's comms hut: Sam shoved 0.17 m or 0.26 m by the first man in decides which way a file with no trail
//      runs — along the room, or out of its open door — rule or no rule); and a file that stood
//      still without the rule stands still with it (printed, not judged: how many of those stand on the very same places — the rule can act for a moment
//      on the walk in, while a man ahead is still on his way round a corner — and how many pairs of places are within the manners' 0.85 m: in a corner
//      with no other floor the rule settles for ORDERS.fileTight, and a man standing where he was near enough is nobody's fault while nobody moves)
//   4. NO FLOOR AND NO STOPPING SHORT: HE HOLDS, HE IS NOT SENT INTO A MATE (ORDERS.fileHold; FILEHOLD_BREAK=1 = the key left off under the rule, must FAIL on
//      both stands). room-clear-four's storage corner, Sam at (33.00, 7.03): a pocket 0.9 m by 0.5 m between the shelves and the open door's lane. On the
//      page's stand the last two walk into it by themselves (line 3's row for that place); the frozen stand's men stop nearer Sam and its storage door shuts
//      behind them, so the corner is STAGED the same way on either stand: doors stay where left, the storage door stood open, Blue One put where he was
//      shoved to (30.89, 4.46) and Blue Two beside him (31.28, 4.91). Key off (the spread alone): both still moving after ten seconds, their places 0.4 m
//      apart. Key on: nobody moving, no two places within 0.6 m, everybody arrived
//   5. the journal: a recording from before the key replays with it off; one that carries it keeps its own word, on or off
// The doorway manners are raised for the staging on either stand (the frozen stand holds them off, and without them the two settle by another road).
// Headless: nothing here says how it looks.
