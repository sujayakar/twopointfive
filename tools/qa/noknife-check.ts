// 'noknife' — NO KNIFE (CLOSE.noKnife, src/game/close.ts). The maintainer's design: "remove the knife, only rmb for non lethal CQC when nothing equipped … then
// we also remove the knife from interrogation. you can still select nothing equipped or the pistol, but there's only rmb to choke out".
//   bun run tools/qa/noknife-check.ts        (also `probes.ts noknife`; run it on BOTH stands: TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the second)
//   blow      empty hands in reach of a man who stands, from behind, from a side and from the front: a left click starts nothing and he is on his feet a second
//             and a half later; a right click puts him down, out cold (the chronicle files a knockout, no kill).
//   hold      a man in the arm: a left click is no kill (no kill phase, he breathes a second later); a right click starts the choke and he goes down choked.
//   draw      with him in the arm no box of Sam's is the knife or its sheath, and his rows name no knife; in reach with empty hands the list says the right
//             click's knockout and no knife. The control: with the key down the arm hold draws the knife.
//   words     the three lesson lines that teach the knife say the knockout instead, and are word for word as written with the key down.
//   off       the key down: the left click from behind kills him with the knife, as it did.
//   harness   the key is a row of the two stands' list with its word, off on the frozen stand and on in the page (`?noknife=0` puts it off), rides a recording's
//             tables, and a recording from before the key replays with it off.
// NOKNIFE_BREAK=1 = the key left down where blow, hold, draw and words ask for it up: each must FAIL.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: nothing here says how the bare-handed hold or the tell without a hilt LOOKS.
