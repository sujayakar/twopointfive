// SQUADS FROM THE ROOMS — the check behind src/game/squaddeal.ts (SQUADDEAL.on: on in the page, ?nosquaddeal; off on the frozen stand, TPS_SQUADDEAL=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/squaddeal-check.ts        (also `probes.ts squaddeal`; run it on BOTH stands: plain, and with TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front)
// The switch is thrown by the check, and the radio check with it (enemysquads.ts SQUADS.radioCheck: the quiet answer is its men — a frozen stand without it
// has nobody miss a silent post, which is another check's business). The floors are staged as tools/qa/answers.ts stages them (the mission's own row, no
// teammates, Sam out of everybody's sight), and (c) (d) (e) are that tool's own reading of ONE level of LEVELS:
//   (a) THE CUT, on every level of LEVELS as its mission deals it: squads are staged; every room of the structure is in exactly one of them; every squad has
//       a man; as many squads as the men call for (`one` or fewer: one · `two` or fewer: two · more: three); their names are the table's; the room clear's
//       own squads check (roomclear.ts checkSquads) has nothing to say against the block;
//   (b) THE FILE WINS: a level that names its squads is handed back as it is (the same object), and its squads are the file's;
//   (c) A LOUD WAY IN AT THE FRONT draws men to the noise, their word on the net `LEAD_S` or more before the first of them is there;
//   (d) A QUIET ONE AT THE BACK draws men to the silent post, their word on the net `LEAD_S` or more before the first of them is there — and they are not
//       the move (c) drew;
//   (e) A BLOWN WALL CHANGES THE WAY THEY COME: the same loud way in with a hole blown, the frame before, in the first wall between the first man who came
//       and the noise — his way is shorter by the walk grid, and he goes through the hole;
//   (f) THE SWITCH OFF = THE BASE: the loud way in of (c) on a stand with the switch off — no squads are staged, no squad says a word, and the run digests
//       as one on a stand the rule was never thrown on (a run the rule changes when it is on: the break path's digest differs);
//   (g) THE MISSION SHEET SAYS SO: Hard on a level the rule cuts into squads is worded as the squads' (difficulty.ts squadsHeld), and as the one pool's with
//       the rule off; the row's own fact (squadsOf: what its level FILE says) is untouched either way.
// SQUADDEAL_BREAK=1 = the rule left OFF for (a) (c) (d) (g) and ON for (f): each must fail.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: a line on the net is a string, a boot is an event. Nobody has seen or heard any of this in play.
