//               done, seconds later
//   a kick      the same with a kick: none in the air when the kick is over and after
//   a takedown  begun inside the wind-up (the game's own start, on a parked man): the wind-up is dropped and the can it counted is back on the belt
//   untouched   a can clicked and nothing begun: it leaves his hand on time, one off the belt (the rule changes no plain throw)
//   off         the rule off: the can freezes through the kick and leaves his hand after it, one off the belt, as it did
