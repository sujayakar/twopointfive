// The 'lineoffire' family: A FRIEND IN A TEAMMATE'S LINE OF FIRE (game/clearline.ts — CLEARLINE.on, off as shipped). Run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts lineoffire | lineoffire-planted | lineoffire-walk | lineoffire-mate | lineoffire-corridor | lineoffire-edge | lineoffire-entry | lineoffire-behind | lineoffire-off
// PASS / FAIL each, headless. A floor of our own (the night office, the shift benched, nobody on it but whoever the probe spawns — roomfight-probes.ts's rig):
// one defender roused and looking down a line at a teammate under one of Sam's ORDERS (orders.ts poses him every frame: the case the room fight's own side
// step never survives), and a friend stood in that line. The teammate cannot be hurt (Guard.god): what is asked is what he DOES, not who wins.
//   lineoffire-planted   Sam stands still in a planted teammate's line: he says so, steps to a clear line and drops the man; two teammates masked at once take
//                        two different spots; the man down, each is back on his mark
//   lineoffire-walk      the same while he WALKS on an order to a mark beyond Sam: the step is taken out of the walk, and the walk goes on to its mark
//   lineoffire-mate      a MATE (flash-blind, going nowhere) in the line: the same step — the base never even asks for one (the gun is down before the gate)
//   lineoffire-corridor  a corridor too narrow to step square with Sam in the middle of it: he gets off the line to cover, or (no cover allowed) onto a knee,
//                        and says which; Sam nearer one wall: he moves up level with him and shoots; walking down it to a door's stack mark: the same answers
//   lineoffire-edge      CLEARLINE.afterEdge (0 as shipped = no such case): Sam in the line ONLY by the wider lane a walking player is owed (stood still where
//                        he is, the round would pass him). With afterEdge 1: he walks past and stops, or taps his walk key — no move, the line opens by itself
//                        and the teammate shoots from his mark; he keeps walking beside it — the move comes after a second, not 0.3 s. Sam's body in the
//                        standing lane (stood dead on the line, stood at the lane's rim, walking along the line) or a blind mate in it behind him: afterEdge
//                        changes nothing, to the frame. (Sam walks on his own keys here: the same WASD-from-the-camera lines as playthrough.ts's driver.)
//   lineoffire-entry     CLEARLINE.inEntry (true as shipped = the rule everywhere): a pair on 'bang and clear', the can gone off, a man comes up the
//                        corridor behind them with Sam between. As shipped both leave the door for cover and the entry is seconds late; with inEntry
//                        off they hold their way in — no step, no cover, no word between the shove and their points — and the room is taken on the
//                        entry's own clock. Outside that window the knob changes nothing, to the frame: on the walk up to the same order's stack,
//                        and for a man planted on a hold order.
//   lineoffire-behind    CLEARLINE.holdBehind (seconds; 0 as shipped = the rule as it was): Sam ahead of him in the corridor and WALKING AT the man. As shipped he
//                        leaves for cover inside a second and a half and is out of the fight; with holdBehind 2 he takes no cover and no knee, says Sam
//                        is in his line and holds on his mark with the man in view — and drops him a third of a second after Sam is out of the line
//                        (as shipped: four to five seconds). Sam stopped in the corridor: nothing for a second and a half (a halt is not a park), cover within three and a half. Sam standing from the
//                        start, or walking at the man in a room with floor to step to: the knob changes nothing, to the frame.
//   lineoffire-still     CLEARLINE.still (seconds; 0 as shipped = the rule as it was): the PLAYER on the move in his line, any direction. As shipped he steps (a
//                        room) or leaves for cover (the corridor) inside a second and a half; with still 2 he does neither while Sam walks nor for two
//                        seconds after, says Sam is in his line, and is on his mark to drop the man the moment Sam is out of it. Sam standing from the
//                        start: the knob changes nothing, to the frame.
//   lineoffire-far       CLEARLINE.stillFar (metres; 0 as shipped = `still` at any range): with still 2 and stillFar 8 a man whose target is nearer than 8 m steps
//                        for a walking player exactly as the rule as first built; at 11.6 m down a corridor he holds exactly as still 2 alone; a standing player is answered at any range
//   lineoffire-holdstep  CLEARLINE.holdStep (true as shipped, with holdBehind 2; every other probe stages the rule as first built, both off): behind a lead walking AT the man no step is taken either; the lead stopped, or standing: as it was
//   lineoffire-off       switch off: none of it — no round, no step, no word, nothing counted (the build as it was; the run-for-run identity against the base
//                        commit is playthrough.ts's PT_DIGEST, not this)
// Every ON case also asks: no teammate's round within a friend's lane (0.45 m of Sam, 0.3 of a mate, in plan, at the flight's height), and nobody faster than
// the team's walking pace (guards.ts PACE.max).
// The family's own red path: LINEOFFIRE_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts lineoffire must FAIL every on-case (the switch left off under them = the base).
