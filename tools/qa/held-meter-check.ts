// A HELD MAN'S LIGHT METER IS THIS HOLD'S — the check behind guards.ts heldVisibility / HELD_METER (the code review's fault: the probe keeps a key's last answer for
// ever, ids are dealt again, and nothing forgot `heldC<id>` / `heldH<id>` when a hold ended — so the next hold read the LAST hold's light as its own until the probe
// answered afresh, and the damp carried it on for a third of a second: a pair in the dark read as lit).
//   bun run tools/qa/held-meter-check.ts            (HELDMETER_BREAK=1 = a probe that will not forget: must fail)
// The headless world has no GPU meter, so nothing a frozen probe plays can show this: here the game's three light hooks (lightQuery / lightAt / lightForget) are
// swapped for a probe that answers NOTHING new (the readback's first frames) and keeps whatever it last had — a stale-answer model. A real hold is staged in the
// dark (standoff-probes.ts stageHold), a colleague looks at the pair, and the held man's meter is read on the first frame he is looked at:
//   (a) a new hold with the last hold's bright answer still under his keys · (b) the same man taken again after a lit hold · (c) nobody looking for a second while
//   the pair moves a room on · (d) nobody looking for a second, the pair where it stood: the answer is still right and is KEPT.
// exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
