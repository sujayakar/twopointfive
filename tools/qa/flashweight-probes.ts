// The 'flashweight' family: A FLASHBANG THAT COUNTS ON A DOOR, AND A TEAM THAT MOVES WITH WEIGHT (the maintainer, 10-05, off the merged build: "it feels like
// flashbangs are too weak. using them for breaching doesn't seem to help" and "teammate movement is too fast. in ready or not they did a good job of making
// everyone feel weighty. they should probably never really sprint"). Run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts flashweight | flashweight-pace | flashweight-flash | flashweight-night | flashweight-fog | flashweight-lights | flashweight-corners | flashweight-entry | flashweight-feel
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts stood up on each row's own level; nothing is drawn). THE SCENARIOS are scene/scenarioList.ts
// SCENARIOS, row by row, each started as a click on its row starts it (bang-tally.ts stage()).
//   flashweight-pace    in each scenario: the team told to fall in behind a Sam who SPRINTS a lap of the floor near the start, then sent to stack on the nearest
//                       held room's door and through it. Every frame, every living teammate: the speed his legs are asked for never passes guards.ts PACE.max
//                       (and so never reaches the animator's sprint band, character.ts BLEND.jogAt), it never rises faster than PACE.accel, and the ground he
//                       actually covers in any quarter second agrees. Not vacuous: somebody must have moved at better than a stroll. The line also says what the
//                       same script does with PACE off and the order paces as they were (the red path: it must show the old run).
//   flashweight-flash   the canister's rule in a room fight (combat.ts FLASH), on a held room of every scenario: a can let off inside the open door —
//                       every defender the fireball has a line to is blind for FLASH.secs and doubled over for FLASH.stagger of it, none of them fires a
//                       round while folded; the team stood outside in plain view of it, past FLASH.ownM, is untouched; the same can behind the SHUT door
//                       touches nobody inside. And FLASH.on false is the dazzle as it was (the team outside is blinded by Sam's own can: the old rule).
//   flashweight-night   the night game's stun canister is as it was: no scenario up, a guard with a line to it is dazzled by effects.ts bang's numbers and
//                       never folded.
//   flashweight-entry   what it buys: bang-tally.ts over every held room's every door in every scenario, a few seeds, 'open and clear' against 'bang and
//                       clear' from the same staging — per scenario the bang must lose a smaller share of the team AND take at least as many rooms.
//                       (FLASHWEIGHT_SEEDS=1-6 widens it; the default is 1-3, ~10 minutes on four cores.)
//   flashweight-lights  LIGHT DISCIPLINE ("friendlies also need to have flashlight discipline"), every scenario, the floor emptied of hostiles first so nothing
//                       but the orders decides: the team falls in, stacks on a held room's door, is sent through it, and is called back. Dark while following,
//                       dark on the stack, every man's light ON as he crosses the frame and while the room is being looked over, dark again within a few
//                       seconds of 'holding the room' (but for a man the entry left on another door of the room — DOORTOOLS.otherDoorM: a door is held lit), dark following Sam out. LIGHTS.on false must show the old picture (lit long after the entry). A light the rule owes is not owed in a LIT PLACE
//                       (LIGHTS.litOff: judged by the rule's own reading of the place); none may burn on in one, and with that rule off nothing is spared.
//   flashweight-corners CHECK THE CORNERS ("teammates clearing rooms seem to miss enemies. they need to check their corners"), every scenario: into an emptied
//                       held room, every man's muzzle is on the near corner of his own side inside DOORTOOLS.cornerCap of crossing, and the entry does not
//                       end until the room's floor has been looked over (fewer than DOORTOOLS.deadCells cells no muzzle was ever on). Then the count that
//                       matters, from bang-tally.ts: entries the team walked out of with men of the room still standing in it ('missed'), the search on
//                       against off, same seeds — on must miss fewer, and lose no more of the team.
//   flashweight-feel    the Tab panel's 'Team feel' rows (game/teamfeel.ts) under a stand-in localStorage: only what differs from the build is stored, a fresh
//                       Game reads it back, a bad stored value is passed over, the reset drops it. Also in the 'ui' family.
// The family's own red path: FLASHWEIGHT_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts flashweight-pace must FAIL (the pace rule switched off under the probe).
