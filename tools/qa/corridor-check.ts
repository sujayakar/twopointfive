//
// The team of four stands where the mission starts it, on hard, and shoots what comes (corridor-hold.ts's hold: the player's 'hold one hallway and pick them
// off'), once with the rule off and once with it on, same seeds. PASS lines:
//   1  off, the fault is there: the men who may leave their rooms walk into the holders' line and drop, some of them where a mate has just dropped (a line
//      about the BASE: if another rule ever mends the fault with this one off, this line goes red and the check wants new seeds or retiring — it is here
//      so lines 3 and 4 cannot pass on an easy seed)
//      (THE FLOOR, 10-13: the block was rebuilt — four rooms off one hall, each round a corner — and `block-four` became one stay-put squad a room: its
//      hold draws nobody, off or on, so lines 1‥5 moved to `block-squads`, the same floor held by three squads, two of which may leave. There a hold costs
//      the defenders four of ten with the rule off — the comms room's three never leave and the rest keep their corners — so line 1 asks a third of the men,
//      two of them fed in after a loss, where it asked 60 % of the old floor's; line 3 asks a third fewer than the off arm's count. Seeds 5, 7, 12 on
//      both stands: off 12 of 30 down, on 6. Over seeds 1‥12, off against on: 44 → 28 of 120 down on the page's stand, 48 → 26 frozen.
//      Before the rebuild the seeds were 3 and 7, then 7 and 9 once alerted defenders burn their weapon lights.)
//   2  on, every run learns a lane and stops men short of it
//   3  on, clearly fewer defenders are picked off than off
//   4  on, fewer walk in where a mate has just dropped and die there
//   5  nothing was added: the same number of defenders stand in both arms, and the off arm ran none of the rule
//   6  a look round the corner (the records office, the hold of the maintainer's own replay: Sam outside the west wall shooting what comes out of the records
//      door, placement 1631): while he stays, a man comes to the corner for a look, finds him still on it and gets back alive — the lane stands
//      (THE FLOOR AS DEALT, 10-18: with squads from the rooms — squaddeal.ts, on in the page — the office's four are one squad and come to the hit room
//      together, so the lane this hold opens is the TEAM's, down the front door, and the look is taken at that door; line 14 is about how they get there)
//   7  the same hold, Sam gone from it after 30 s: a look finds the lane empty and it is forgotten
//      (played with squads from the rooms held off — `AS_WRITTEN`: only Sam can leave a hold here, and on the floor as dealt the guns the lane knows
//      are the team's, which stay. The floor this line was written on.)
//   8  held at two angles (150 s a hold): a man goes round as far as where the guns would first see him and sets there, and fire comes from a
//      corner. Asked of `PIN_HOLDS` in turn: `PIN_FLOOR` holds must show all three (a man set, a man sent to his corner, a round fired from it) — it
//      stops at the second that does, or once the floor is out of reach. Why not one hold: it stood on one seed of the old block until the squad's own
//      rule for a door an enemy opens (`ROOMFIGHT.doorEars`, 10-12) changed that fight, and other steps have moved other seeds since. THE REBUILT BLOCK
//      NEVER SHOWS IT (10-13: one hall, and every way to the hall's far side crosses it in the guns' sight for 30 m — `round()` says "no way round" on
//      all twelve holds), so the line is asked of the two charges (`defuse-four`: seeds 7, 8, 10 of 1‥12 show it on the page's stand) and the glasshouse
//      (seed 7). A quarter of a floor's holds showing it is what there is; the floor is there so a real drop reads red more often than not.
//      PLAYED WITH SQUADS FROM THE ROOMS HELD OFF (10-18, `AS_WRITTEN`): on the two charges as dealt the garrison is two squads that come to a hit room
//      together and dig in on their squad's word, and there is seldom a man left to send round — 1 of 19 holds set a man on a lane's other side (seed 12
//      of 1‥19, the page's stand). The line still asks the mechanism, on the floor it was read on; that the dealt floors seldom show it is said in the
//      area file (docs/agents/enemies.md, the covered lanes), not hidden here.
//      Two clauses hold SWITCHES, not behaviour: `goes` 0 on every hold played = `LANES.pinGo` ships off (nothing else counts a run-in), and one
//      hold with `LANES.pin` off sets nobody and sends nobody to a corner
//   9  a magazine change the rule started behind a corner is counted down ONCE: with the guard code counting the same reload (a man with his head down
//      under fire, or putting rounds into cover — stood in for here by the check's own count each frame) it takes the weapon's time, not half of it; and
//      with nobody else counting, the rule counts it and it takes the same
//      (CORRIDOR_BREAK reds it through the second half; the first half is red only on the old double count — 79 frames for 156 — shown by hand, 10-11)
//  10  a quiet round past a man who has not noticed it opens no lane (`LANES.roused`: two suppressed rounds at a lamp past a calm, pinned man were called a
//      held corridor on a replay); the same round past a man who is roused does, and with the key off any round does
//  11  a rifle's lane knows the floor its rounds reach THROUGH A PANE (`LANES.glass`: the lane's own lines are asked at the energy of the gun that opened
//      it; a man stopped 'out of the guns' line' behind the records hall's pane was shot through it); with the key off the pane hides that floor
//      (10 and 11 alone: `--mends`, ~10 s)
//  12  a grenade down the lane that pins him (`LANES.frag`, 10-13): in one of `FRAG_HOLDS` (the floor as dealt) a man held on a lane who carries a grenade throws it, and it
//      bursts within `FRAG_NEAR` m of where one of the team stood (the team here may get off it, and Sam cannot be hurt: the line asks where it burst, not
//      who it hit); nobody is lost throwing one on the holds played; and the same hold with that key off: no man held on a lane throws. `FRAG_HOLDS` are
//      asked in turn until one shows it (until 10-18 the line rode line 8's holds; those are now played as written). (The floor deals one defender in three a grenade, three a floor — frag.ts — so a hold with no
//      carrier held on a lane shows none: of the two charges' seeds 1‥24 on the page's stand, 18 show one.)
//  13  his own while he throws (`LANES.fragOwn`, 10-15): a man who has shouted for a lane is not walked off his arc by the dig-in inside the wind-up's second
//      (the room fight plants a man who has arrived, the dig-in adopts a planted man and sends him to its cover: he then kept the grenade and said so).
//      `OWN_HOLDS` in turn, each cut short just past the throw, until one shows it: with the key off a lane grenade stays in a hand; on, that grenade
//      leaves it (one more away than off) and none stays. THE OFF ARM IS ABOUT THE BASE: it needs a hold where the dig-in takes a thrower inside his second — 2 of the two
//      charges' seeds 1‥24 on the page's stand of 10-15 (10 and 12). A later step that moves those two fights reds this line with the rule intact: play
//      `corridor-hold.ts --scn defuse-four --seeds 1-24 --secs 150 --level hard --set '{"LANES":{"fragOwn":false},"SQUADDEAL":{"on":false}}'` and re-pick
//      from `fragKept`. RE-PICKED 10-18 and PLAYED `AS_WRITTEN` since: steps since 10-15 had moved both fights with squads held off too (of seeds 1‥24
//      only 6 and 11 keep a grenade, and 6's is not the dig-in's doing), and on the two charges as dealt no hold shows the fault at all (0 of 12, seeds
//      1‥6 and 13‥18: there the dig-in is the squad's word). THE ON ARM since then is the off arm's own fight with the key put on partway
//      (corridor-hold.ts `flip`, `OWN_HOLDS`' fourth number): the key changes the fight from the hold's first lane grenade on, so two whole runs no
//      longer meet at the same shout — seed 11's kept grenade is its second
//      AND WITH THE GUN DEAL HELD OFF (10-19, `AS_ARMED`): the defenders' gun roles change who carries what here, and as dealt seed 11 keeps no grenade
//      (re-pick with `"GUNROLES":{"on":false}` in the set above as well)
//  14  the doorway drill is asked again (`LANES.drill`, 10-18): line 6's hold on the floor as dealt. The first man lost in the front door marks it for the
//      drill AND opens the lane, and the drill took the next men in the second before the lane was called: with the key off a second man (and a third) is
//      lost slicing the same door `LATE` s or more after the first, the lane long called (45 s played); on, line 6's own run loses nobody after the
//      first, and men are stopped short of the lane.
//      THE OFF ARM IS ABOUT THE BASE, as line 13's is: a step that keeps the drill off that door some other way reds this line with the rule intact
//  15  the seam with the hostage rescue's flush (rescueflush.ts, 10-19): the flush sends the men left for the hostages and asks this rule only which door
//      (its own check, rescueflush-check.ts (g) (h), holds that: nobody kept back, the covered door not chosen). What a man SENT does at a corridor a
//      lane covers is this rule's: on a rescue floor with the room fallen and a lane planted over the floor outside every door of it, the men sent are
//      stopped short of it (none stands in its line before a look is under way), one looks, finds it empty, the lane is forgotten, and only then is a
//      man of theirs in the room. No team is on the floor: what the lane's own acts do under fire is lines 2‥8's.
// CORRIDOR_BREAK=1 = the 'on' arm played with the switch left off: lines 2‥4 and 6‥15 must FAIL (exit 1).
// (Lines 7, 8 and 13 are played on the page's stand with ONE row of it put off, `SQUADDEAL.on` — each says why: they ask the rule's mechanism on the floor
// it was read on, and no longer say what the page's own dealt floors do. Lines 6, 12 and 14 are the floors as the page deals them.)
// Lines 6 to 15 are always asked of the page's stand (TPS_PROFILE=shipped): run from the frozen stand (probes.ts) they are played in a child of this file
// (`--look`), since on the frozen stand nobody is sent at the lane and so nobody is held at its mouth to look (and no round passes glass).
// Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a FAIL or an error. ~7 min on a quiet four-core box (line 15 half a minute; three holds an arm; a red line 8 plays up to four holds: a minute more; line 13 two short holds, four when its first no longer shows the fault).
