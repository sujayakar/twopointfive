// LESSON-RUN: a scripted player through a Training level (game/lesson.ts), headless. For each step of the level's `scenarios.lesson` block, in order:
//   1. half a second of doing nothing — the step must still be up ("the line moves on when the thing is done, not on a timer")
//   2. the level's script for that step (tools/qa/lessons/<name>.ts `steps[<id>]`): what a player would do, through the INPUT only — movement keys toward a
//      nav path, one-frame key presses, the cursor, clicks, the wheel
//   3. half a second more, and the step must have gone by (FAIL names it and says what the lesson saw)
// then the script's `finish` plays the mission out and the run must END (`ended`, default: the mission's stage is 'done').
//
//   bun run tools/qa/lesson-run.ts <name> [--seed N] [--unseen] [--god] [--plain] [--verbose] [--digest] [--nolesson] [--pace N]
//     --unseen     his light meter pinned at 0.05 (default: fed every frame from the CPU's estimate of the light on him — guards.ts lightEstimateAt — so the
//                  floor's own lamps decide what the shift sees and what a `meter` test reads)
//     --god        rounds do not drop him
//     --plain      neither, whatever the script's own `mode` asks for
//     --digest     print one word folded from game/digest.ts's digest of every half second
//     --pace N     N seconds of reading before each step's deed (a person, not a script: the floor goes on meanwhile — lesson-gate plays one such run on the shipped stand)
//     --nolesson   the switch off: the SAME keys with no lesson (nothing asserted about steps) — its --digest must equal the lesson-on run's
//     --moon       the MOON on his meter too: the CPU's estimate leaves it out (guards.ts lightEstimateAt), so a mark in the open yard read 0 here and 56 % on the
//                  page (a player's tape, 10-13: the scripted run went by unseen where he was spotted). One ray up the moon's own direction from his chest and his
//                  head; unshadowed it adds the moon's direct light (0.54 on the meter, the page's 0.56 less its bounce). A script asks for it with `mode.moon`
//     --sky        THE SKY'S LIGHT ON EVERY METER: --moon for his own, and the same sum (the CPU's estimate where the man is — an authored hour's sun and
//                  sky are in it — plus the night's moon where nothing solid is up its direction) for every man an AI eye looks at and every man's own.
//                  And THE NIGHT SKY'S OWN LIGHT where a point has open sky (about 0.08 W/m2 in the open, LIGHT 20; --noglow = the moon alone).
//                  ON BY DEFAULT FOR A TUTORIAL MISSION (--nosky, or the script's `mode.sky: false` with why). Still not the page's: no bounce (a lane the page's meter calls lit by bounce reads dark here: --floor), no bodies' shadows,
//                  no smoke between a light and a man
//     --floor N    his meter never under N (0‥1): the bounce neither estimate has — a moon shadow in the open yard read 0.16 on the page, the walled wood store 0 to 0.06
//                  (and every other meter with it — a unit's own, a body's: a partner reads the light on himself, and on the page that is the renderer's.
//                  Give it what a GPU showed)
//     --hard       the level's name set to hard before the game is stood up (game/difficulty.ts setDifficulty: what the page's ?difficulty=hard does on a lesson)
//   exit 0 = every step went by on its deed and the run ended · 1 = a step did not / moved on by itself / the run did not end · 2 = no such level or script
//
// A SCRIPT (tools/qa/lessons/<name>.ts) exports
//   query: string                              what the page's URL would carry besides levelFile: '?quiet', '?quiet&squad=1', '?roomclear=1&squad=2' …
//   steps: Record<stepId, (B: Bot) => void>    one per step of the block, by id. A script NEVER reads g.lesson (the --nolesson arm must press the same keys)
//   finish?(B: Bot): void                      after the last step: on to the mission's end
//   ended?(g): boolean                         the run is over (default g.mission.stage === 'done')
