// The room fight (src/game/roomfight.ts): both sides of a room clear fighting on their own read. `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts roomfight` = the family.
//
//   roomfight-entry     the same seed, the same three men in the break room, the noise at a different door: they end up watching — and with their guns on — the
//                       door it came from, not the one a plan names; a door merely TRIED by a teammate is heard and watched; a bang moves the watch; and with the
//                       room lost the survivor leaves by a door the trouble did not come from, so he ends up somewhere else
//   roomfight-flank     one defender who has had a door kicked: a teammate through THAT door meets a man with his gun on it, a teammate through the room's other
//                       door meets his shoulder — sixteen seeds each: the unwatched entry drops him without a round coming back far more often
//   roomfight-nextroom  a defender posted in the corridor outside: with a fight in the break room he can hear (real rounds) he comes; with none he stands; with
//                       gunfire where his side has nobody he stays too
//   roomfight-sight     a teammate fires at a defender he has a lit, smoke-free sight of — and not at one in the dark, nor at a lit one through smoke (the
//                       renderer's answer planted on the pair's key), nor at one behind his back
//   roomfight-eyes      ROOMFIGHT.sights: a teammate with his rifle in the shoulder sees a man along his aim that the eye between chest and head leaves out;
//                       nothing he saw before is lost; the other side's eye and anybody's reading of Sam are as they were (ROOMFIGHT_EYES_BREAK=1 = the red path)
//   roomfight-friends   the night breach at its default over fifteen seeds with Sam idle, and eight with Sam (god mode) walked into the room behind the charge:
//                       no teammate's round passes within a body's breadth of Sam or of the other teammate; and nothing in those runs was staged — the drill
//                       fired no round of its own (BreachDrill.rounds 0, no eyes / shot / guaranteed beat), every defender down was dropped by a round
//   roomfight-duel      the even meeting: one teammate, one defender, both roused, face to face in the same light, twenty-four seeds — the teammate wins
//                       clearly more often than not, and the defender still wins some (lethality is the same both ways)
//   roomfight-off       ROOMFIGHT.on false = the night breach as its branch had it (the staged exchange fires again); with no unit on the floor the module
//                       is not live and ten seeded seconds of the night game digest the same with the switch either way
// Headless there is no renderer: the light on a man is the CPU estimate of the direct light (guards.ts lightEstimateAt), the smoke between two men is clear unless
// a probe plants the segment's answer, and nothing here says anything about what the picture shows.
