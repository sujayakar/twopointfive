// AN OPEN FIRE BURNS (src/game/fire.ts FIRE / updateFire; the flame is render/shaders/fire.wgsl, the embers are GPU particles; the light is the level's own lamp).
//
// The maintainer, 10-23: "we gotta improve our fire! we have barrels with fire on them … great fire with smoke and crackles and dynamic lighting would look sick."
//
//   bun run tools/qa/fire-check.ts [--verbose]      exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a FAIL line
//   FIRE_BREAK=1 …   = the switch never raised and the same lines asked: must fail
//   FIREBOOK_BREAK=1 … = the host's put-back run with its line for the fire's book undone: the second load line must fail
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts fire
//   Run it on BOTH stands (TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the page's): it puts the switch where each line needs it by the stand's own word, TPS_FIRE.
//
// The harness has no GPU, no smoke solver and no speaker: what is proven HERE is what the game hands on (the lamp's strength and place frame by frame, the
// record the renderer is given, the sources it would file with the solver, the mixer's calls) and what the CPU's light estimate reads beside the drum — never
// a flame seen or a crack heard. tools/qa/fire-page.cjs looks at the page.
//   burns     the pass, switch on, twenty seconds: its brazier is found, the lamp's strength swings about the authored one (its mean within a tenth of
//             it) and its place is the table's lift over where the level hung it and wanders by no more than the table says, and the renderer is handed one fire at the drum's mouth
//   same      … the swing is a closed form of the game's clock: a second game stood the same way has the same strength every frame, and the lamp is what
//             fireFlicker says for that time
//   sound     one bed voice held at a time (handed on every FIRE.bedSecs), and a crack for each pop of the wood, about as often as the table says
//   smoke     with a solver drawing: a source a second, as wide as the drum, its foot over the flames and over a standing man's head, every one LOOK ONLY, on the
//             coarse lattice, none thicker than the table says; with
//             none drawing, or with the smoke alone put off (?firesmoke=0): no source at all
//   out       the lamp put out (as a round or the jammer would): the frame after, no fire is handed to the renderer, no source, no crack, and the lamp is
//             back where the level hung it; lit again, it burns again
//   load      a checkpoint put back: the lamp, its place and the coals are that moment's on the frame it loads
//   steady    a rule that asks for the PLACE's steady light (lightEstimateAt, steadyOnly) reads the authored lamp where the level hung it: with the fire
//             burning, the same number every frame as with the switch off
//   meter     what the CPU's light estimate reads a long stride from the drum, three metres and five metres off, switch on against off: the mean within a tenth, and
//             how far it swings (printed: the figure the area file quotes)
//   size      while it burns the lamp is as big as the flame (FIRE.size × the mouth) and the steady readers still take it for the size the level gave it, a hand
//             from the lamp where the two sizes differ most; the level's size back the frame the switch goes off; `size` 0 (the page's ?firesize=0) = the level's
//             size burning; a recording from before the key replays with it 0
//   fog       under the fog of war a fire is drawn as the team last saw it: its record says wherever it stands while it burns and is known to; only where the
//             team sees when the fog has its lamp as one lit unseen (RtLight.fog 1, said by hand); with the fog itself raised and the squad at its start,
//             the frame the fire is put out its record is one at full heat for where the team does not see (the lamp's ghost up, the lamp itself as the
//             level hung it); with FIRE.fog off (?firefog=0) only where the team sees and no ghost; a recording from before the key replays with it off
//   look      the flame's numbers (FIRE.look) reach the renderer as they stand (engine.fireLook, sixteen numbers); the embers are GPU particles: sparks flagged
//             embers, filed over the coals with a seed made by hand from the host's own book, about as many as the table says; with no pool none are filed
//             and the two games differ in nothing; FIRE.embers 0 = none; a recording from before the key replays with no shimmer, no drawn smoke, no embers
//   gas       FIRE.gas on with a solver drawing: a look-only source on the FINE lattice at the coals every `every` s, as wide and as dense as the table says, and
//             the fire's record tells the picture to draw the flame from it (eased to 1); with no solver drawing or put off: none, and the flame of noise;
//             a recording from before the key replays with it off
//   off       switch off: the lamp steady at the authored strength where the level hung it, nothing handed to the renderer, the solver or the mixer
//   old       a recording from before the key replays with it off (journal.ts applyKnobs)
