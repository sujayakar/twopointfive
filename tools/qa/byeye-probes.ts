// The 'by-eye' probe: LIT TO WHOM (sneak.ts SNEAK.byEye — litSeen). Run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts by-eye        (family: sneak)
// PASS / FAIL each, headless. The pair-up rig's open strip at night (pairup-probes.ts rig): one defender stood looking down it, the partner at its far
// end, and the partner's OWN METER planted the way a GPU page reads an open night shadow (the software renderer and the CPU's estimate read it near 0; the
// maintainer's HUD showed 14 to 27 of 100). The probe asks the sneak's own map (sneakWalk: what the partner's way to a man is planned over) which steps
// down the strip are WATCHED and what a walk across it costs, then gives the order and watches his feet:
//   · with the switch off the flaw is there: a dim meter makes every step with a line watched, out to the end of the eye's reach
//   · with it on only the steps near enough for THAT eye to gain on a crouched man are — no further than the guards' own arithmetic allows for the
//     meter planted (the probe's own sum), and never a step that was not watched before; the brighter the meter the further out
//   · a bright meter is watched all the way out either way · a meter under the lit number is watched nowhere either way
//   · a walk across the far end costs nothing with it on and something with it off; a walk across the near end costs the same either way
//   · an upright man is watched further out than a crouched one (the eye's own posture term)
//   · THE FOLLOWER (the office's corridor, the pair squadded up and silent as sneak-probes.ts has them; one defender stood at its far end looking down it,
//     every meter never under 0.16, Sam walked low to 8.7 m from him): with the switch off the partner hangs back out of the eye's reach, metres behind
//     Sam; with it on he comes up to his place behind Sam, and the defender's awareness is no higher for it
//   · the pair lesson itself (tut-pair, its scripted player, hard), Sam's meter never under 0.27 as the lesson runner's --floor has it, plays to its end
//     with the switch on (when this rule was written the lesson's level had lines on the partner's way and the run did not end with it off; the level
//     was rebuilt since so that no way of his has a line, and the two arms end alike there: the corridor above is the differential now)
//   · off, nothing reads its number · the stand's own word · a recording carries the key
// What it cannot say: what a GPU reads (the meter here is the probe's hand; nothing was seen on a GPU, nobody has played it). Not staged: a kit card that
// makes a man plainer to see (kitload.ts loadSeen, counted in the gate), an alerted eye, a door frame's funnel.
// The probe's own red path: BYEYE_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts by-eye must FAIL (the switch reads on and the flat number decides).
