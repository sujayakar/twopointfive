// A SPRINT INTO A DOOR HAS WEIGHT — the check behind src/game/sprintdoor.ts (SPRINTDOOR.on: on in the page, ?nosprintdoor; off on the frozen stand, TPS_SPRINTDOOR=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/sprintdoor-check.ts        (also `probes.ts sprintdoor`; run it on BOTH stands: plain, and TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front)
// Headless; nothing here looks at a picture. The office with nobody in it, the one-way doors and the frame rule as the page has them, the switch thrown by hand;
// every run is the real player under real keys (W + Shift held from 3 m off, the camera turned so W runs him square at the leaf) on two doors with that much
// floor before both faces. Each rule line is run with the switch on AND off and passes only when the rule shows on and the old behaviour shows off:
//   (1) the face it opens AWAY from, unlocked: a shoulder through it — the loud bash, the leaf leaving him at `bashVel` (it leads him), he keeps `keep` of his speed (0.75) and
//       has the sprint back inside half a second, through no more than a tenth of a second later than before (off: not a centimetre a second lost);
//   (2) the face it opens TOWARD, unlocked and shut in its frame: a boot at the run — he plants short of the leaf (never touching it: no bash, no thud), the
//       leaf comes off its hinges away from him with the kicked door's own noise, he is through the open frame with the keys still held about a second later
//       than before (off: full speed through a leaf hauled round on the full bash);
//   (2b) where a boot is not the thing (`kick: false`, or doors that never come off): the handle — checked to about a walk, the leaf brought round toward him
//       at the lower loudness (the game's own event for it is not `loud`), sprinting again and through about a third of a second later than before;
//   (2c) the boot's edges: none at a leaf standing ajar, none with the frame rule off, none from a run begun on top of the door; one from a stride off;
//   (2d) booted out of a room onto a corridor (no room beyond for the leaf to lie in): off its hinges all the same, the slab back down through its doorway;
//   (3) locked against him: the kick from the face it opens away from, a wall and nothing broken from the other — the same in both arms;
//   (4) a glancing shoulder costs less than a square one, and so does a leaf met standing ajar (the module's own rule, asked directly: 60° off square costs half);
//   (5) his body turns a shoulder into the leaf for a quarter second and comes back square, his head staying on the run; it is the shoulder nearer the LATCH
//       that leads — asked on a door and on the same door hung the other way, where the turn must come out the other way round;
//   (6) the stamps ride a checkpoint taken mid-rip;
//   (7) never on a puppet or under a show: his contact carries nothing;
//   (8) off: he goes through both faces on the full bash, no contact carries the rule, neither stamp is ever written, the sprint eases his gun down as ever.
//       A SANITY LINE: 'off = the build as it was' is the frame-for-frame comparison with the build head named in docs/agents/doors.md, and the gate's digests.
// SPRINTDOOR_BREAK=1 = the switch left OFF for the 'on' arms: (1), (2), (2b), (2c), (2d) and (5) must fail.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
