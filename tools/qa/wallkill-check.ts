// the maintainer, 10-19, god mode off, 0.9 m from a charge he had set on a wall when he blew it — the log said 'you were too close' and he walked on:

// stand with its room clear dealt. Headless: who is down and who is blind is the game's own state; the body thrown and the frame are the page's to show.
