// The 'cover-keep' probe: A MAN TOLD TO COVER KEEPS HIS ANGLE (roomfight.ts ROOMFIGHT.coverKeep — coverPasses). Run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts cover-keep        (family: roomfight)
// PASS / FAIL each, headless. The plan lesson's level (levels/tut-plan.json) stood up with its four men and ONE of its enemies, the probe's puppet: he is
// stood where the probe wants him each frame, cannot be killed, sees nothing, and his muzzle points where the probe points it. Blue One is told to cover
// up the lane from the back gate, as a player tells him; Red One stands beside him covering the side the puppet comes up on; the other two see nothing.
// Then the puppet is stood a quarter turn off Blue One's way, and the probe reads where Blue One's gun goes:
//   · with the switch off the flaw is there: his gun leaves the lane for the man Red One is already shooting at
//   · with it on it does not, and Red One is on the man the whole time
//   · … and the man is his again: with his muzzle on Blue One · with no mate on him · with the mate's gun behind a jamb · inside coverNearM · stood in the
//     angle Blue One was given; and a man he was on first is not dropped for a mate who has only just seen him
// Not shown: the hand-over of a man he is on to a mate who IS past his beat to fire (nobody fires here), a mate reloading or with a friend in his line.
//   · off, nothing reads the rule's numbers · the stand's own word · a recording carries the key
// Nobody's round goes in the staging (the probe holds every man's first shot off) so that the man is there to be looked at for the whole run, and the
// floor is hot, as it was when it was played: a sighting is a man.
// What it cannot say: what it looks like (never seen on a GPU, nobody has played it), or what it does to a fight — that is playthrough.ts's tally.
// The probe's own red path: COVERKEEP_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts cover-keep must FAIL (the rule does nothing with its switch on).
