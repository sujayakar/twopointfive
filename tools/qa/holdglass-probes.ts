//   holdglass-loud      a loud pair shoots him through the glass, noticed or not — as it did before the rule

//   holdglass-other     while they hold on him an alert man on their side of the glass is shot, promptly and without the muzzle going to and fro (the held man
//                       is not one to stay on); two men behind the glass: no round, the muzzle settles; their guns on a calm man their side, the man behind the
//                       glass goes alert: he is the one shot; holdFire off: no hold
//   holdglass-open      no glass on the line: a quiet gun on a silent man shoots as ever (the rule is about the pane)
//   holdglass-off       SILENT.glass off = the build before the rule (the suspicious man is shot through the pane); and a loud minute digests the same every
