// THE KNOB REGISTRY'S CHECK (src/game/knobs.ts) — `bun run tools/qa/knobs-check.ts`, and `probes.ts journal-knobs` (family journal):
//   1. what a recording carries (journal.ts knobTables) is JOURNAL_KNOBS, name for name and in order, every one a registry table;
//      … and every table journal.ts asks a FILE for (`k.tables.X`, the rules that put a key off for a recording from before it) is one a recording carries;
//   2. every table the squad's feel panel keeps (teamfeel.ts feelTables) is in the registry under the same name AND is the same object;
//   3. knobsCopy → scribble → knobsBack puts every table back exactly (every value changed at every depth, a key added to every object, an element to every
//      array), in place (every nested object and array is still the same object);
//   4. every exported ALL-CAPS table under src/game that carries a boolean `on` is in the registry, or in UNREGISTERED below with its reason — a NEW one that is
//      in neither is a failure (a table with no such switch is not seen by this scan: it joins the registry by hand).
// Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a check failed.
