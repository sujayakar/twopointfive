// The 'irlight' family: AN INFRARED LIGHT ON THE GOGGLES (the maintainer, 10-15: "maybe we should model IR lights on the nvg so even totally dark rooms are
// visible. and we can assume enemies never have nvg"). The rule is game/irlight.ts; this family is its check. Run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts irlight | irl-list | irl-unseen | irl-team | irl-off | irl-auto | irl-meter          (both stands: TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front for the page's)
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts stood up on each scenario's own level, started as a click on its row starts it — bang-tally.ts
// stage()). NOTHING IS DRAWN: how a room reads through the tube under the flood is not judged here and has never been seen on a GPU; the GPU's light meter is
// not run (headless it is the CPU stand-in). What is held is the mechanism: which lights exist, in which list, with which bits, and who reads them.
//   irl-list    WHO BURNS ONE, AND WHERE IT IS KEPT. Every scenario: Sam's once his goggles are down (and out again when they are up), one per teammate whose
//               goggles are down and for no other man, never an enemy's; each a spot at its carrier's brow along his aim at IRLIGHT.power through the tube;
//               never in the list every other reader sums (LightSet.lights). The upload: with the picture bare-eyed not one is handed to the renderer; with
//               the tube's, each is, flagged infrared and NOT transient (a steady light: the flash's path costs the bounce a ray per flood per hit), at the tail — and no light of the level's ever carries the infrared bit. The shader's
//               text: the light meter's reading (probe.wgsl → evalLightTrue) and the cascades' (directIrradiance) both refuse the bit.
//   irl-unseen  NOBODY WITHOUT GOGGLES READS ONE. Every scenario played through a held door from one seed with Sam's goggles down: the light on (the team
//               half off — yours alone) and off (the first scenario a third time, as the control). Hashed every frame: the whole game's digest, every man's awareness, state, light and visibility,
//               every camera, the light list, and the CPU's light estimate on the floor in front of Sam — where his flood falls. On ≡ off, while the count
//               says the flood was there. Its red path: IRLIGHT_BREAK=1 puts the infrared lights where a careless build would — in the list everybody
//               sums — and this probe must FAIL.
//   irl-team    A GOGGLED TEAMMATE SEES BY IT, AND NO PLACE IS TOO DARK FOR HIS TUBE. A man with no light on him at all, stood in a goggled teammate's
//               flood: that teammate's tube reads him; with the team half off, the switch off, out of the cone or behind a wall it reads nothing, and an
//               enemy's eye reads nothing ever. The same held-door play with the light on and off: not one man-frame 'too dark for the tube' with it on.
//   irl-off     THE SWITCH AND THE STANDS: off = no infrared light anywhere and the tube's term as nvg.ts had it; the frozen stand holds it off
//               (TPS_IRLIGHT=1 raises it), the shipped stand has it on as the page does; the Team feel rows are kept by teamfeel.ts.
//   irl-auto    IT BURNS ONLY WHERE IT IS TOO DARK FOR THE TUBE (IRLIGHT.auto; the maintainer, 10-16: "is it realistic to only have them turn on when it's
//               actually too dark to see?"). Every scenario, the places taken off the level itself (Sam's start, every door, every enemy's spot): Sam stood
//               with his goggles down where every floor he could look at inside 13 m reads over NVG.blackAt through the tube by the place's own light — no
//               light of his burns, the same place with the rule off and it does; stood on floor that reads black — it burns inside a tenth of a second
//               and is at full by half; back in the light — it is out IRLIGHT.hold and its fade later and not before. The team, played four seconds: no
//               goggled man on black floor is without his, no goggled man who can look at no black floor keeps one, and no man with his goggles up has
//               one. One light on open floor never reads past the tube's hot shoulder beyond arm's length (the brightness that was asked down). Its red
//               path: IRAUTO_BREAK=1 calls every place dark, and this probe must FAIL. The other four probes hold the rule OFF: they check a light that
//               burns whenever the goggles are down.
//   irl-meter   WHAT THE CPU CALLS DARK IS PUT TO THE RENDERER'S METER (IRLIGHT.meter; the maintainer, 10-18, of a strongroom with its own bulb off: "still
//               feels like the IR light here is unnecessary" — the CPU's estimate has no bounced light, so every room with no lamp of its own was black
//               to the rule). No renderer here: its answers are PLANTED through the hooks the harness swaps (Game.lightAt), and what is held is who
//               decides. Every scenario, Sam stood on floor the CPU's estimate calls black, his goggles brought down afresh: the renderer answers 'lit'
//               — not one frame of his light, nor of a teammate's, and with the switch off the same answers and it burns (the build before); it answers
//               'dark' — burning inside a tenth of a second and at full at once; it answers Sam's own meter and nothing else (a starved probe) — no
//               light until IRL_METER.wait, then the CPU's word; it answers nothing at all (headless as it is) or the senses are on the CPU (SENSE.cpu)
//               — nothing asked and the CPU's word at once, the rule as it was. The line is the PICTURE's (IRLIGHT.show of the tube's range) and so is
//               the bounce: an answer over the line by itself and under it × settings.indirectScale is dark, and with the scale at 1 it is not. Where the CPU calls the place light nothing is asked.
//               What a carrier asks is bounded (IRL_METER.slots a beat) and forgotten with his goggles. The stands, the FROZEN_HOLDS row and a
//               recording from before the key. Its red path: IRMETER_BREAK=1 holds the switch off where this probe turns it on, and it must FAIL.
//               The budget's own red path: IRSLOTS_BREAK=1 has every carrier ask one point more a beat than the rule's number, and it must FAIL.
//               irl-auto and the four before it hold this switch OFF (headless it changes nothing: no renderer answers).
