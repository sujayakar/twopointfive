// EACH GUN ITS OWN LOOK, SOUND AND FLAME (src/game/gunlook.ts GUNLOOK; `GUNLOOK_BREAK=1` must fail). How each is FED is gunreload-check.ts's.
//   own     every row a pick of the two gun slots can hand out (gunslots.ts PICKS; + the big slot's pump gun) names a MODEL, a VOICE, a
//           FLAME and a CASING row — and no two guns share a model, a voice or a flame: by name, and by what is in them (two models' part lists, two
//           voices' samples, two flames' numbers are never the same); the cases two guns may share a COLOUR and a calibre of are said in SAME_CASE below;
//           a model's muzzle is its own far face, its magazine is one of its parts, its support hand is on it
//   hands   a teammate staged with every pick and you with every pick: the figure is told which model is in his hands and which hangs or rides holstered,
//           his muzzle and his support hand are that model's, what is drawn for him is that gun's own boxes (no two guns draw the same), and a round fired
//           plays that gun's voice
//   bare    a teammate whose card has the suppressor off carries the issue guns' bare rows (weapons.ts mk18bare, g19bare): the long gun is drawn with a
//           bare barrel where its can was, to the same muzzle, and the pistol — in his hand or on his thigh — with nothing ahead of its slide; with the
//           can on each is drawn as it always was; a suppressor row a gun (the gear tree), on his card and on yours
// SINCE 2026-11-07 NOTHING HERE WRITES A SETTLED ROW: the look, the two gun rows, the gear tree and the deal of the kit are constants of the game. Until
// then every staging was made twice, the switch on and off, and wrote the deal off under every line. Cut: the off half of four lines of `hands` (the
// stand-in's muzzle, the issue carbine's length on you, the stand-in's voice) and its two comparisons with the off run (every gun drawn differently from
// its stand-in, the issue pair drawn as it was); of `bare`, the off half of one line, its two lines for the switch off and its two for a stand with no
// gear tree. `GUNLOOK_BREAK=1` is gunlook.ts's own. It raises the big slot itself (a run's own). Nothing here looks at a picture or hears a sound
// (tools/qa/gunlook-sheet.ts and gunlook-plates.ts draw the pictures; the listening page plays the voices).
