// LYING SNOW IN A BLOWN HOLE'S MOUTH GOES WITH THE BLAST — the check behind FURN.mouth.snow (src/game/furnblast.ts mouthMine; on in the page, ?holesnow=0;
// off in the module and on the frozen stand, TPS_HOLESNOW=1; acts only with FURN.mouth.on).
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts holesnow        (family `furnblast`)        HOLESNOW_BREAK=1 = the rule off and the same lines asked: must FAIL
// the maintainer, 10-15, of a wall charge on the pass (levels/pass.json, the level made for snow): "couldn't path through a hole from a wall breach". His tape: the charge
// cut 1.56 m out of the tea room's outer wall and two snow banks at its foot (tops 0.22 and 0.36 m: over the 0.2 m a body and the walk grid meet) stood in the
// gap — he slid along it, the path went 12.8 m round by the door, and the charge's own 'is it a hole' ray met the bank and said "it held".
// THE SITES: his own (the wall by the floor point 11.4, 7.7, set from the side he stood on) and up to five more places on the level (the biggest banks first) where a snow bank that stops feet
// lies at the foot of a wall the game offers a charge on, and the first of those once more with its bank DRAWN OUT TO 15 M by the check itself (the level's own
// long banks left the walls' feet on 10-15: without this nothing here is over the furniture's size bar, and no feed row could be longer than its hole). At each, a fresh stand of the level with the page's destruction switches, a charge set as the order
// sets it and blown as F blows it; then the charge's own verdict, a body as wide as the player pushed through the gap with the player's own collision call, and
// the walk grid asked for the way from one side to the other.
