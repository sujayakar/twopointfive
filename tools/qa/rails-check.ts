// A TUTORIAL MISSION'S FRAME — the check behind src/game/rails.ts (RAILS.on: on in the page, ?rails=0; off on the frozen stand, TPS_RAILS=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/rails-check.ts [--verbose]      (also `probes.ts rails`, family missions; run it on BOTH stands: plain, and TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front)
// Headless, on levels/tut-sky.json (the first tutorial mission), the switch thrown by hand after each stand-up. Nothing here looks at a picture.
//   1. the level's lesson block is whole (lesson-check's own faults, the rails keys among them);
//   2. SWITCH OFF: the level is its mission alone — no lesson, the player stands on the floor where the file starts him, nothing is locked (the command key orders the
//      squad on the first step), the level's program is not started;
//   3. SWITCH ON, the first step: the player is parked out of the picture and out of every sense, the view rides the squad, the program is running and has
//      had the step's cue (its men are on the road); the command key is LOCKED (no order, the press counted as dropped) and so are the zoom and the walk keys;
//      only the turn of the view is open;
//   4. ONE ACTION A STEP: the turn done, the zoom opens and the walk keys do not; then the walk keys shift the view and nobody's feet; then the command key
//      orders the squad, and the order reaches the program (the squad's smoke goes out);
//   5. A STEP IS DONE BY ITS DEED: nothing done for ten seconds on the first step, it is still up, and the squad has not left its trucks;
//   6. NOBODY IS LOST: a teammate who would go down is on a knee and up again after the level's seconds; a man of the other side goes down as ever;
//   7. AN AUTHORED CHECKPOINT: the first step's was kept (and no other save was taken on the way); put back from two steps on, the lesson is on that step
//      again, the program was started again and had its cue again, and only what that step unlocked is open;
//   8. the room fight goes on beside the program (ROOMFIGHT's own `on`), and the scenario does not end as taken while a step is up;
//   9. the journal: a recording from before the key replays with the frame off, one that carries it keeps its own word;
//  10. THE MISSION AGAIN: Shift rides with Enter through the gate (the restart's keys) and alone does not; the seat's unseen player is no cheat to the verdict;
//      a restart from a later step is on the first step, only its action open, before a tick has passed, and does not end; the mission left, he is seen again.
//  14. THE ROWS (`rails.rows`, on levels/tut-quiet.json): Space offers only the verbs the mission names — at a locked door the pick and no boot; without
//      the list, every row the door has anywhere; and no row at all while Space itself is locked (the gate beside the start). And his own actions' ring (handring.ts) is worked with its own digit while it is up: on the whistle's
//      step the digit alone does nothing, the key kept down and then the digit whistles. A digit pressed inside the hold, before the ring is up,
//      whistles too and is no slot's.
//  THE SECOND PLAY'S NOTES (tut-sky): the roadblock's fire lands over many places and none by a man; Shift down with the command key gives the order while
//      the plan is locked (RAILS.shiftTap); a line says what the men are doing once its order is out and asks again when nothing comes of it (a step's
//      `after`, RAILS.afterSecs / afterMax); a line with no key in it is one to watch; the page's input lets go of a modifier the system says is up.
//  THE GATE'S BEAT: the squad set in the yard, the roadblock comes down the road (the script's `direct` walk) and the line is gone within eight seconds;
//      with that word taken off its men, and covered lanes on (the page's stand), it is long. No break of its own: the second run is its proof.
//  THE BIG LINE AND YOUR OWN MEN (ui/railclear.ts, Rails.lineMen, RAILS.lineClear): the line has two places, where it lies and the bottom edge, and is at
//      the edge while a man of yours is under where it lies; the frame lists the squad, and the player when he is on the floor. And a deed can name the
//      man an order was given on. RAILS_BREAK=1 reaches this line through the list alone (nobody on it); the rule on boxes and the deed have no break.
//  THE FRAME'S EYES ARE THE PLAYER'S VIEW (fogofwar.ts update, RAILS.eyeFirst, RAILS.eyeView): a step's eye has a place among the fog's five, and a man
//      only a frame's eye has is drawn, not seen: the squad's entry on his room's door is the one it would take with no eye there. RAILS_BREAK=1 reaches
//      both lines through the step's eye (none is named under it).
// RAILS_BREAK=1 = the gate lets everything through, the ring is no place, nothing keeps it in the picture and the menu lists every order: lines 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, the last line's, the wall's, the stalk's, the first play's notes', the second play's, the card's, the card's beat's, the spared man's (reached through guards.ts acquireFoe and roomfight.ts tickMove, both staged; qrf.ts, tactics.ts and frag.ts are held by a read of their source only), the big line's, the two of the step's eye and the plan on the move must fail (the opening card's line is data and a screen: no break of its own).   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
