// The 'laststand' family (game/laststand.ts — what the last few defenders of a room clear do once most are down: two switches, both shipped off), run through
// probes.ts:   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts laststand | laststand-callout | laststand-regroup | laststand-keep
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless — no picture and no sound here. Each stages levels/compound.json (five on eleven, three squads), leaves the team on its start
// mark and takes the defenders down by hand to the three the probe names, so the endgame starts on a known floor.
//   laststand-callout   `callOut` alone against both switches off, same seed: every man, door and item digests the same every half second (telling only);
//                       off = no state at all; on = a radio check, answers naming the rooms the men are truly in, the count and the asker's room, the strip
//                       draws them, the objective brackets exactly those rooms and its marker sits on one; a man with the team in his sight does not answer
//                       and is not counted; down to one, he says he is the last and where (a man at his post: the net names his room; a man out hunting:
//                       it names none). LASTSTAND_BREAK=1 = call out off for the two last-man runs: those two lines must fail
//   laststand-regroup   `regroup`: nothing before three are left; then the check, an order naming one room, the others say so and walk to it, every man of it
//                       digs in and sets, one of them says the room is shut; the rooms they left are clear for the room clear and the marker is on the stand;
//                       two minutes later they are still set in it (no stand-down), still asking the net by the room's name
//   laststand-keep      `regroup` with the Keep's three (a squad whose men stay in its rooms): whoever moves stays inside the Keep's rooms
//   laststand-few       'most are down' is never more than a third of the staging: on the block's eight (levels/block.json) three up says nothing, two
//                       up starts the check
