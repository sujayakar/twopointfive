//   · tools/qa/lesson-check.ts <level>            the block against its file, its floor and the list
//   · tools/qa/lesson-run.ts <level> --digest     the scripted player does every step and the run ends (in the arm the lesson's script declares)
//   · the same with --nolesson                    the same keys with the lesson switched off: the run's digest word must be the same word
//   · TPS_PROFILE=shipped lesson-run, FOUR dice   the game as the PAGE opens it (src/host/profile.ts): seeds 1 and 2 with six seconds of reading before each step, seeds 3 and 4 at the
//                                                 script's own pace — still every step, still the end, on all four (one seed hid a fight the pair lost on three dice in eight)
