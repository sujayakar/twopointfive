// The 'nvg' family: THE TEAM'S NIGHT VISION (the maintainer, 10-06: "the squad members should have night vision and use it accordingly. this could either be
// following your lead or knowing when they haven't been compromised and flashlight would ruin that" · "but the lights make sense too, especially when things
// are loud" · "ready or not is a good base case here"). The rule is game/nvg.ts; this family is its check. Run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts nvg | nvg-quiet | nvg-lead | nvg-loud | nvg-sight | nvg-fight | nvg-rig | nvg-off
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts stood up on each row's own level; nothing is drawn). THE SCENARIOS are scene/scenarioList.ts
// SCENARIOS, row by row, each started as a click on its row starts it (bang-tally.ts stage()).
//   nvg-quiet   NOT COMPROMISED, IN THE DARK: every scenario with the floor emptied of hostiles (nothing but the rule decides), the team told to fall in and then
//               sent to stack on a held room's door — the walk af55d89 lit ("a pair sent down a dark corridor"). The team is 'dark' the whole way, no weapon
//               light burns but a man's whom the tube shows nothing (no light of the place at all somewhere he is looking: nvg.ts blackAt — the log line says
//               so), and every unlit man in a dim place has his goggles down (a moonlit lot is not dim: bare eyes, no light). The same walk with NVG.on false shows the old picture: lights, no goggles.
//   nvg-lead    FOLLOWING SAM'S LEAD, both ways. His goggles down and his light off on a floor that has just gone LOUD: the team stays dark all the same, not
//               one light, black places included. His own weapon light on, on a quiet floor: theirs are free again (the light rule's picture, as with the
//               switch off), and dark again a moment after he puts it out. NVG.lead false: his goggles decide nothing.
//   nvg-loud    ITS OWN JUDGEMENT. A charge goes off in the team's ears: 'compromised' inside a frame, the walk is lit again by the light rule, a lit man's
//               goggles come up. NVG.quietSecs of quiet later the team goes dark again and one of them says so. An alarm on the floor does the same as the
//               charge. NVG.own false: no judgement of its own (lights by the light rule).
//   nvg-sight   WHAT THE GOGGLES DO, through the one sight function (guards.ts sightGainOn). The tube's curve is the picture's own (post.wgsl's lines are
//               still the ones nvg.ts copies), monotone, nothing from nothing. Then every living hostile of every scenario where he stands, at eight metres:
//               the same eye with goggles down against bare — hostiles a bare eye has no real sighting of and the tube does must exist, the tube never sees
//               LESS, a man in a place with no light at all is as unseen as before, a man with his goggles up gains nothing, and a hostile's eye is the same
//               with the switch on or off (they have none).
//   nvg-fight   END TO END: Sam's goggles down (the team dark whatever happens), the team sent through a held door with the room's men alive, every
//               scenario. Not one weapon light burns from start to finish, and the team still takes targets: counted, the ones it could only have taken
//               through the tube (the fight's own sight test on that frame says a real sighting with the goggles and none without).
//   nvg-rig     ON THE MAN: every living teammate's rig has the goggles' four boxes (down over the eyes and glowing when they are down, parked on the
//               forehead and dim when up), no hostile has any, and with the switch off nobody has.
//   nvg-off     THE SWITCH: NVG.on false is the module absent — no state, no goggles, no sight term, nothing said — and the Tab panel's rows are kept by
//               teamfeel.ts like the others. (The frame-for-frame identity against af55d89 is `bun run tools/qa/nvg-probes.ts digest`: it prints one hash per
//               scenario of a scripted minute with the switch off; the same file copied into a checkout of af55d89 must print the same lines.)
//               Not frozen as a fixture: the per-frame digests frozen elsewhere in this harness do not reproduce from one machine's maths library to
//               another's (needs-identity's does not on linux), so the two checkouts are run side by side on the same machine instead.
// The family's own red path: NVG_BREAK=1 bun run tools/qa/probes.ts nvg-quiet must FAIL (the rule switched off under the probe).
