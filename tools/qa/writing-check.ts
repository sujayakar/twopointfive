// THE WRITING GUIDE'S CHECK (the agents' index, "Writing for the player"; docs/agents/writing.md): the text a player reads, held to the patterns the guide
// rules out. It reads what is DATA: every level's lesson block (the big line, its other lines, the after lines, the cards) and every mission row (blurb,
// opening scene, the "You will learn" rows, the row's `only` line).
// A LESSON'S LINE IS READ AS THE PLAYER READS IT: a line or a card names a move by a token (`{grab him}`, game/lesson.ts TOKENS) and the build writes the
// token out by the keys it has, so each is put through `lessonLine` on all four ways the two switches can stand (the held click or the grab's key, the knife
// or none) and every sentence that comes out is held to the rules. The four tokens are written out of 'him' on their own as well, so a token no level uses
// yet is read too.
//   bun run tools/qa/writing-check.ts [--list]      (also `probes.ts writing`, in families ui and words; no stand: nothing of the game runs)
//   key      a key is pressed by "you": no key cap followed by a colon ("[B]: stack up"), no sentence of a line or a card that opens on a key cap
//            ("[B] on the door"; `[X]` is drawn "Hold Q" and may open one)
//   colon    no colon in a lesson's line or card: ideas are joined with words (a mission row may keep a colon that opens a list)
//   opener   a line does not open on a bare "In." / "On," / "To the …" / "Out by …" / "Back to …" / "Through …", on "Where …", or on a participle
//            ("Stacked on a door, …")
//   tail     no verbless phrase tacked on after a comma (", his back to you"; "with his back to you" is the sentence said whole)
//   words    everyday American words: no torch, mains, fuse box, lorry, "round" for around, armoury, metre, whilst, towards, "out cold", "take hold of",
//            "your word"; in a lesson and a tutorial row an enemy is an enemy or a guard, never "a man" / "men"
//   short    a pronoun and its verb are contracted (he's, they're, you'll, it's, don't, can't): "he is coming", "do not turn" are not how it is said
//   self     the rules catch the sentences the guide was written from and pass their rewrites: each BEFORE below trips a rule, each AFTER trips none
// WRITING_BREAK=1 = the BEFORE sentences are read as if a level carried them, and the grab's token is written out as a key and a colon ("[Space]: grab him"):
// the check must FAIL on both.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// A pattern catches a colon after a key or a missing contraction; only a reader catches a sentence nobody would say. The guide's review step (every changed
// line read aloud, by its writer and by a second reader) is not replaced by this.
