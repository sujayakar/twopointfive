// THE ROWS CUT FROM THE MISSION LIST ARE DRAWN ON NO LIST, AND STILL OPEN BY THEIR OWN ADDRESS — scene/scenarios.ts `offList`, ui/missions.ts OFFLIST_UI /
// listedMissions. The maintainer's tap, 2026-10-13 ('Three'): the four-man office room clear and both yard rows leave the list, and one of the two block rows
// when the block's rebuild says which (it said: the three squads); their rows, level files and
// every check that names them stay. The night breach joined them 2026-10-24 (the maintainer: "let's also remove "night breach" since it's unnecessary now"):
// its row, its address and the checks that stage it stay, and it is on the short list no more (line 6). Headless: the lists as data and the two screens on the fake DOM (tools/qa/scenario-picker-probes.ts El / withDom).
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts offlist        (family missions)        bun run tools/qa/offlist-check.ts
//   1. the table: the rows that carry `offList` are exactly the ones his tap named, and each is still a row of the table with its own address
//   2. the module's default is OFF (the page's entry puts it on — main.ts): in a harness the lists hold every row, as every list probe pins them
//   3. on: listedMissions and the start page's list hold every other row once, in the order they stood, and none of the cut ones; so do both screens' rows
//   4. on: a cut row still reads back from its own address (missionOfQuery), and a visit that names one (`?loadout=<id>`, a `select`) has it drawn that once
//   5. off (?offlist=0): the lists are the whole table again
//   6. no row of the short list (scene/picks.ts PICKS) starts a cut row: a card would offer what the list has dropped
//   OFFLIST_BREAK=1  the switch is left off where the lines above want it on: the check must FAIL (exit 1) — the proof that it can
// exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
