// WHOLE PLAY-THROUGHS WITH A WATCHER — every scenario on the start card played from its staging to its end by a scripted player who is ON THE FLOOR (Sam on his
// own feet: keys along the nav grid's path, the team told to fall in behind him, each held room taken through the order menu's own calls), while a watcher
// looks at every teammate every frame for the things a competent operator would not be seen doing. The tallies (roomclear-tally, bang-tally, rescue-tally)

//   PT_HURRY=1 (env)                       room scenarios: no walk in and no gathering after an entry — the next door is stacked on as soon as the last ends

//   PT_FIRST=shop (env)                   room clear: the commander's first room is that one of the structure (its id) instead of the nearest held room
//   PT_LISTEN=1 (env)                     room clear, defender squads: a commander who HEARS 'in position — we have the door!' — for 60 s after a man of a pair sent
//                                          round is set on a door (read off the squads' timeline; =N for N s) he does not take the team through that door

//   PT_GUNWALL=1 (env)                    every run's JSON carries `gunwall` (tools/qa/gunwall-watch.ts): every spell a weapon in a man's hands stood in or through a static or a
//                                         door leaf (the flaw src/game/gunwall.ts mends), by carriage and by side, and how often that rule brought a gun down. A bystander
//   PT_FOGFIRE=1 (env)                    every run's JSON carries `fogfire` (tools/qa/fogfire-watch.ts): under the fog of war, the aimed rounds teammates fired, how many
//                                         at a man the fog's eyes did not have that frame, how many at a man NOT IN THE PICTURE (the flaw fogofwar.ts FOG.squadFire mends) and why. A bystander
//   PT_LIGHTWALL=1 (env)                  every run's JSON carries `lightwall` (tools/qa/lightwall-watch.ts): every spell a burning weapon light stood beyond a static or a

//   PT_PATHS=1 | rec (env)                every run's JSON carries `paths` (tools/qa/paths-watch.ts): every spell a man of a room entry spent in a door leaf (or a leaf

//                                         crossing of the entry's frame line with its gap to the man before; `rec` adds the men's places and the leaves' angles at

//   exit 0 = every run ended by the scenario's own rules with no exception · 1 = a run threw or stalled · 2 = unknown flag / scenario (nothing run)
//   (the SMELLS are counted and listed, never a verdict by themselves: each is a place to look, with the scenario, seed and second to trace it at)
//
// THE SCRIPTED PLAYER (a test driver, nothing in the game): 'fall in', walk to a few metres short of the nearest entry of the nearest room that is still held,
// off the line of its opening; 'stack up' on that door; 'bang and clear' while the squad has a can, else 'open and clear'; wait for the door tools to call the
// entry over; walk in himself; next room. The rescue: fall in, walk the corridor to a post short of the hostage room, F, walk in when it is secured. Sam is in
// god mode, never fires and is NOT SEEN (his light meter pinned dark, as the tallies pin it: a player who cannot be hurt and is seen would draw every round
// off the team, which is what is under test) — but he is heard, and his body is in the way, as a player's is.
// HE STEPS OUT OF HIS MEN'S FIRE: whenever he stands in the line between a teammate and the man that teammate is on, he side-steps 1.3 m off it (offLine) and
// then goes on. A commander who never fires and is never shot at, standing in a doorway face to face with a hostile, made every teammate behind him hold his
// fire and die: it measured the driver, not the team. PT_STAND=1 puts that statue back (every table made before the change was made with him).
// PT_STILL=1: off the line he STANDS until it clears. The default steps back into the line the frame after he left it and out again the next, 2.6 cm each
// way, so for as long as a line lasts he is 'walking' at 1.5 m/s by the squad's measure of the player and nothing that waits on him standing ever runs.
// HE SHUTS AN OPEN LEAF HE IS WEDGED ON: where a walk was about to be given up ('Sam is stuck') against an open door leaf standing across his way — the nav grid
// knows no leaves — he pulls it to with its own row and walks on, once a walk (shutLeaf; the run's JSON lists them under `leaves`). A booted door stood into a
// walkway used to end the run on the time cap. PT_NOLEAF=1 = the commander who gave up there (tables made before it; a run where he never got that far is the same).
//
// THE SMELLS (per living teammate, per frame):
//   stuck      under an order with a mark he is not on, not in a fight, not blinded — and he has not covered 0.25 m in 4 s
//   hung       the same order unarrived for 45 s (he may be moving: a walk that never ends)
//   overlap    two of the team (Sam counts) inside 0.3 m of each other for 0.75 s
//   doorway    standing still for 4 s inside a door's opening with no door tool working that door and no fight
//   flag       gun up (not lowered by the muzzle discipline), and a friend (Sam counts) inside 5 m in plain view within 0.3 m of the muzzle's line, for 1.5 s
//   wall       on his mark with his chest squarely on a wall under 0.7 m away for 6 s (holding / following: looking at nothing)
//   snap       his aim jumps more than 60° inside a tenth of a second (a gun and a weapon light that teleport instead of travelling; an ordered gun
//              travels at PACE.turn 8 rad/s = 46° in a tenth, a little more with his body turning under it — over 60° is a jump, or a man onto a threat)
//   twitch     his aim swings back and forth: four reversals inside 2 s, each swing 15° or more (a man flicking between two things). The line says whether
//              he was on REAR SECURITY and whose his gun was over the 3 s before ('gun: order@-2.1 → cover:rear:Red One@-1.8 → order@-1.5 …')
//   behind     under 'fall in', more than 9 m from Sam for 12 s with no fight
//   block      Sam walking and not getting anywhere for 1.5 s with a teammate inside 0.9 m of him (body-blocked)
//   unaware    a teammate killed by a man more than 75° off where his gun was pointing, while not blinded (shot in the side or the back)
//   friendly   a teammate, or a hostage, killed by one of the team (or by Sam)
// EVERY TEAMMATE'S DEATH is also kept with what he was doing (RunOut.deaths, in --json: his order, his target, whether he was on his killer, how far off his
// muzzle the killer stood, the beat he still owed, gun down for a friend, light, blind …) — the raw material for 'why do they die' tables.
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: no light meter (what a man sees of another is guards.ts's direct-light estimate), no smoke sight lines, no picture, no feel.
