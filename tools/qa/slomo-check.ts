// A REPLAY'S PACES UNDER THE PICTURE (src/replay/engineplay.ts TAPE_SPEEDS: ¼× ½× 1× 2× 4×). The steps a frame runs, and where a slow frame is drawn between the
// tape's last two steps, are two small functions with no page under them (paceFrame, slowBlend); this holds them:
//   · at 1×, 2× and 4× a frame runs the steps it ran before there was a pace under 1 (the loop as it stood, kept here, on uneven frames and mixed step lengths),
//   · at every pace the tape's steps are run in order, none skipped or run twice, and a second of the display plays `pace` seconds of the tape,
//   · at ¼× and ½× the picture moves on EVERY frame, never backwards and never past the last step run — on a tape of even steps by the display's time × the pace
//     (on uneven steps a step's movement is shown over the next step's length: unbroken, not held to the pace),
//   · a frozen second of the display runs a capped burst and owes nothing after it; the end of the tape runs nothing.
// SLOMO_BREAK=1 makes a slow frame stand on the last step (the picture then moves one frame in four at ¼×): 'the picture moves on every frame' must fail.
//   bun run tools/qa/slomo-check.ts          exit 0 = all pass · 1 = a line failed
// The player itself (the men drawn between two steps, a tape played slow and then to its end) is the real page's: engine-replay-page.cjs `between`; the bar
// and its keys are that tool's `slow` and probes.ts cardreplay.
