// The `workthings` probes (src/game/workthings.ts: a teammate is sent to work the breaker, or the mission's thing) — `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts workthings`,
// or one of work-breaker / work-four / work-objective / work-edges / work-posted / work-face / work-held / work-walk / work-defuse / work-off / work-harness. All headless on the real Game (nothing is drawn: the menu is read as the data
// the panel is built from), every order given THROUGH THE INPUT as the page writes it — the harness cursor on the thing, then one-frame presses. WORK.on is
// raised by the probe itself: the frozen stand holds it off (TPS_WORKTHINGS=1).
//   work-breaker    the room clear's pair on the office: X with the cursor on the breaker panel lists the thing's own order on digit 1 where 'move there' is
//                   on floor, no row on a digit above 5; 1 gives it — one man walks to the panel (never sprinting), squares to it, puts a hand on it and the
//                   mains go; his partner covers behind him; he then HOLDS by the panel and the breaker STAYS thrown (a teammate standing by it does not re-arm
//                   it, and the 'go and check it' errand is not handed to a teammate); then B on the panel is 're-arm the mains', and he puts them back
//   work-four       the squad of four: the order to all goes to ONE pair — one works, one covers — and the other pair is left exactly as it was
//   work-objective  a quiet mission with a partner: once the objective is to take the thing, X on its holder lists 'take …' on 1, the partner goes and takes
//                   it (the mission moves on to the way out, in the level's own words); before that stage the holder is plain floor
//   work-edges      what is NOT the breaker (the top of its wall, the next room's floor behind it, a metre in front), Sam standing at it with the cursor on
//                   himself is himself, and a man the orders stop short of it holds where he is: the breaker is not thrown from there
//   work-defuse     a mission's charge (defuse.ts): sent to it he makes it safe and says so; the run ending under his hand (Sam down) leaves the charge armed,
//                   and he neither says 'charge is safe.' nor is a job counted done; the same for a quiet mission's partner with his hands in the holder
//                   (he does not take it, and does not say it is already gone)
//   work-held       the squad's fire held and a defender who has noticed nobody stood in plain sight of the panel: the man sent still throws the breaker (his
//                   partner's gun on that man, no round fired), his footfalls turn nobody at the panel, and the moment that man notices he is the squad's to shoot again. Asserts the fault with
//                   WORK.heldPass off (his muzzle stays on the man, the mains stay on); WORKHELD_BREAK=1 leaves the rule off for the rule's own lines: must fail
//   work-walk       a quiet level as two (levels/lights-out.json): the partner throws the breaker on order, a defender is sent to the panel, Sam calls 'fall in'
//                   and walks on the way that man is coming. Asserts the fault with WORK.offWalk off (the follower waits for the man's back ON the man's
//                   walk and is walked into: the alarm) and the rule with it on (he goes on after Sam, low, nobody roused, the mains put back by the man
//                   sent); WORKWALK_BREAK=1 leaves the rule off for the rule's own lines: must fail
//   work-off        the switch off: the menu on the panel is the floor's (or nothing), the order cannot be given, no thing is listed
//   work-harness    the frozen stand holds it off, the page turns it on unless ?noworkthings, the table is a registered knob table a recording carries
