// SQUADS THAT STAY IN THEIR ROOMS STILL MISS A ROOM THAT GOES SILENT — the check behind src/game/stayask.ts (STAYASK.on: on in the page, ?nostayask; off on
// the frozen stand, TPS_STAYASK=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/stayask-check.ts        (also `probes.ts stayask`; run it on BOTH stands: plain, and with TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front)
// The floors are staged as tools/qa/answers.ts stages them (the mission's own row, no teammates, Sam out of everybody's sight) and its quiet plan is run on
// them: the back room's men put down one a second without a sound. The switch is thrown by the check (through the stand's own word for it, so the staging
// reads it), and the squads' senses with it as the page has them (enemysquads.ts SQUADS.radioCheck · noticedEyes · callBeat: a frozen stand holds them off).
//   (a) (b) on each level of STAY (every squad told to stay in its rooms): the roll call, the squad asked for by name, and the word that one man goes are on
//       the net in that order; ONE man leaves his post before any squad is in contact; his word is `LEAD_S` or more before he is at the silent post; his
//       squad keeps a man at home;
//   (c) a level with a squad that may leave its rooms (LEAVES): the rule does not hold there — no roll call of the squads is said;
//   (d) a lesson whose squads all stay (LESSON): the rule does not hold there either — no roll call;
//   (e) the switch off = the base: the same quiet way in on a stand with the switch off — no roll call, nobody leaves his post before a contact, and the
//       run digests as one on a stand the rule was never thrown on (a run the rule changes when it is on: the break path's digest differs);
//   (f) a squad's count of its own men is as it was: ONE man of a room put down quietly — what his mate does and what the net says are the same with the
//       rule on and off (the roll call aside): nobody says he is alone, no other squad sends a man.
// STAYASK_BREAK=1 = the rule left OFF for (a) (b) and ON for (e): each must fail ((c) (d) (f) hold either way: they are where the rule does nothing).
// exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: a line on the net is a string, a boot is an event. Nobody has seen or heard any of this in play.
