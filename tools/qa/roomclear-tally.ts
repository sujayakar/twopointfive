// WHAT IT IS. The ?roomclear structure (game/roomclear.ts: four held rooms, five defenders dealt per seed) played headless under SCRIPTED PLAYER POLICIES — test
// drivers only: every policy is a list of the orders a player could give from the squad's command menu (game/orders.ts SquadOrders.give — the same call the menu's
// release makes), given at the moments a player could give them (off what he could see or hear: a man on his mark, a room called, a door open). Nothing here is
// in the game: both sides fight on their own read (game/roomfight.ts) exactly as they do in the page.
//
// WHAT THE SCRIPTED PLAYER IS NOT. Sam does not fight in these runs. He is the commander only — unseen and unheard (Game.playerInvisible), put where a player
// would stand for the instant each order is given (an order's door side and a move's facing are read off where he stands) and kept off the floor the rest of
// the time (Run.here: his body would stop rounds and gag his own men). An order's target is built here, not picked with the cursor (the menu's own rules for
// what the cursor is on are not exercised), and giving it takes no time; walking to where it is given from does. The TEAM IS THE PAIR (ROOMCLEAR.pairOnly:
// both teammates down = the structure lost), so the table measures the orders, not anybody's aim with the mouse. A real player adds a third gun and a body
// that can be shot; this tally cannot say what either is worth.
//
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: no light meter (what a man sees of another is guards.ts's direct-light estimate), no smoke sight lines, no fog of war on screen, no feel.
