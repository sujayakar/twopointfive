// HOW MUCH OF THE GUARDS A QUIET MISSION SHOWS, THREE WAYS — numbers for the sticky cameras' page (src/game/stickycam.ts). A measuring tool: nothing of the game is edited.
//   bun run tools/qa/sticky-cover.ts --tape <replay.json[.gz]> [--out results.json] [--label name]      an F7 replay re-run off its run tape (tools/qa/rerun.ts)
//   bun run tools/qa/sticky-cover.ts --ghost <level.json> [--seeds 1-3] [--jobs 3] [--cap 420] [--out results.json]   solo-night.ts's scripted ghost on the level's quiet mission
//   both: [--live N|all] [--fov deg]   how many stuck cameras are eyes at once (default stickycam.ts STICKY.live; all = every one, as the tool first measured) and the
//   lens (default STICKY.fovDeg as the run left it: a tape's own). ONE LIVE FEED = a camera shows only until the next one is up, each taken to go up the second he first can.
// THE THREE WAYS: (1) ALL SHOWN = every guard always drawn · (2) FOG OF WAR = a guard is drawn only while the player's own eye has a line to him — 'all round'
// (360°) and 'cone' (FOG.coneDeg about his gaze + FOG.coneNearM all round) · (3) FOG + STICKY CAMERAS = (2) or a stuck camera has a line to him.
// THE LINE is fogofwar.ts lineToMan's, written out (it is private there): inside the eye's field in plan, and col.segmentBlocked clear to his chest bone or, behind a
// blocked chest, to his head bone — statics and door leaves where they stand, glass passed. The player's eye = his head bone (cone: gazeOf). A camera's eye is
// stickycam.ts stickyEyes' own: lens = camLens (pos + n · STICKY.off), look = the wall's normal in plan, field STICKY.fovDeg, no near field.
// SAMPLED at 4 Hz of game time, per guard hostile to the player, alive and not down: `shown` under each way, and NEAR-HIDDEN = within NEAR_M (12 m, plan) of the
// player with no line from him (the samples a camera can matter in). CAMERAS: candidates = wall points he could have shot one at — once a second along his path,
// 24 level rays from STICKY.aimY out to 30 m (col.raycast; statics only, |n.y| < 0.3), each usable from that second + 1, de-duplicated on a 1 m grid PER FACING
// (the two faces of one thin wall are two places), the earliest kept. Two placements, k = 2 and 3:
//   BEST   greedy by the near-hidden samples the placement shows with one more camera in it, each from its own second and only while its feed is live —
//          an upper bound: a player who knows the patrols
//   NAIVE  no knowledge of the patrols: the candidates that see the most floor (1 m lattice of free nav cells at chest height inside the wedge, ≤ 25 m, doors as
//          they stood when the point was first reachable), at least 6 m apart
// WHAT IT IS NOT: no smoke on a line (the fog's second step), no light (a fog eye has none), no flight (a camera is taken to stick where a level ray from his head
// height lands: the real one flies an arc and can drop), no fog-eye budget (FOG_EYES), no choosing WHEN to put a camera up (each goes up the second he first can), no noise of the tube, nobody reacting to it. The fog's memory (a last-seen mark) is not 'shown'.
// THE GHOST IS UNSEEN AND UNHURT, NOT UNHEARD. g.playerInvisible mutes his sight and his FOOTFALLS only (guards.ts hearingCheck: the 'step' branch alone asks it).
// He walks upright by the shortest way and PICKS every lock on it — KICKS the leaf where there is no lock to pick (a keypad door) — and a pick's ticks, the bolt's
// snap and above all a kick (heard like a shot) are door events every guard in earshot hears: men leave their patrols for them and walk to the door he is at.
// So a man met while he is roused (Guard.state other than 'patrol' — 'suspicious' | 'search' | 'alert' — at the meeting or at any sample of the --warn s before it)
// is NOT COUNTED as a meeting or a surprise: it is the ghost's own noise that brought him, not the fog that hid him. Such meetings are their own number ("met while
// roused by the ghost's own noise: n, not counted"). --loud = the count as the tool first made it, roused men and all (both counts are in the JSON either way: an
// arm's `calm` and `loud`). A --tape is a person's run, whose guards are roused by what he did: it is counted --loud unless --calm is given. Breadth, not a person's run.
//
// HOW FAIR THE FOG IS, PER AID (the ARMS; printed under every run, and as one table by --all-quiet): every arm is read off the SAME walk, so they compare.
//   bun run tools/qa/sticky-cover.ts --all-quiet [--seeds 1-3] [--jobs 3] [--cap 420] [--out results.json] [--md table.md]     every quiet mission level in turn
//   --deal seed|die: the mission's deal pinned to the run's seed (?quiet=<seed>; --all-quiet's default) or off the Game's die (a plain --ghost, as it was: every seed is then ONE deal)
//   --listed: THE MISSION AS THE LIST'S OWN ROW OPENS IT — no pin (scenarios.ts scenarioQuery writes a bare `quiet` for a row with no seed, and no QUIET_MISSIONS row
//             has one), which on the shipped stand, where SAMESTART.on is up (host/profile.ts pageSwitches), is quiet.ts dealOne's start 1 / spot 1 / patrol 1 on
//             every load. One run a level (it is one deal). A PINNED DEAL (--deal seed) IS A VARIANT A PLAYER REACHES ONLY BY A URL PIN. The rows built for two are
//             still walked alone (the row's own `squad=1` is left off).
//   --meetings: one line per meeting, counted or dropped (time, guard, where both stood, distance, his state, seconds shown before per arm, the verdict), then the
//             ghost's door verbs and every guard's changes of state: what a number is made of. --loud / --calm: see the top.
//   flags: --meet 8 (m) --warn 4 (s) --seen 0.5 (s) · --carry 2 · --live 1 · --shoot 15 (m) · --legmax 0 (s; 0 = rooms only) · --wandsecs (WAND.feedSecs) · --wandfov (WAND.fovDeg) · --marksecs (WAND.markSecs)

//   A MEETING = a guard's first sample within --meet m of the player WITH the player's own line to him (the fog's line test). It is a SURPRISE when in the --warn s
//   before it the arm's eyes had shown him for less than --seen s in total: the first the player knows of him is at close range. (A meeting in the run's first --seen s
