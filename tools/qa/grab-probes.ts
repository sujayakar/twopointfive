// behind takes him — a Space TAP on it grabs on the tap's frame, Space HELD opens the list and grabs on the release (player.ts startGrab / updateHold; the silent
// takedown is a left click with the hands empty), the pair moves as one with his key opening keyed doors, his 'question him' row (a tap: it is the highlighted
// one) runs the dialogue engine on its own pacing, his 'choke him out' row chosen and tapped puts him out (killGuard 'choked': out cold, breathing, the
// ragdoll) unless a second tap stops it, there is no letting him go (E draws the pistol to his head instead — the gun variant from there, gunhold-probes.ts
// hold-draw); a held man is off the AI and off the net (guards.ts held branch / offNet). Each stands the full game up headless (headless.ts), stages one
// situation, drives it through the REAL input path where the grammar is the point (input.keys / pressed / clicked, the rows), prints what happened, PASS /
// FAIL. All of it with the pistol HOLSTERED first (armStandUp): the grab takes the arm variant — the one this family is about; the pistol-to-the-head variant a
// drawn gun would make of the same press has its own family (gunhold-probes.ts).
