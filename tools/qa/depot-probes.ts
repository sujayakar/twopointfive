// The 'depot' family — the depot's own facts (levels/depot.json ← tools/levels/depot.ts: a motor pool at night, three huts round a floodlit yard; its room clear
// structure, team start and second way in are in the file's `scenarios` block — rebuild/scenario-levels/contract.md), run through probes.ts:
//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts depot | depot-level | depot-stage | depot-doors | depot-openings | depot-walk | depot-run
// PASS / FAIL each, all headless (the Game of headless.ts stood up on the depot's Level — standUp({ level })). The level is ONE PROBLEM — the signals hut and
// the store's hatch hold the lit yard in a crossfire from the dark, and the hut's own door is at its back — and what is pinned here is the geometry that
// problem stands on, asked with the game's own sight test (guards.ts eyeContact: 16 m of reach, the cone, chest and head against the solids), walk grid and
// headless light meter (guards.ts lightEstimateAt: direct light, no moon, no bounce). Nothing here says who wins. The harness draws nothing: what the level
// LOOKS like, how the floodlights fall on a GPU and whether the dark slits read as dark on screen are untested here.
//   depot-level     the file is the generator's level (0 diffs), the validator and the lint are clean on it, and it is inside the renderer's fixed sizes (world
//                   box, boxes, glass panes); its thirteen doors by name (no gate in the north wall: the main gate, west, is an opening), the signals hut's
//                   ONE door (b_n), the mains panel inside the generator room with the three floodlights on it, and a second way in outside the back gate
//   depot-stage     the four squad boots on it: the structure is sound against the level (roomclear.ts checkStructure), four teammates and five defenders stand,
//                   on floor, apart; seed 0 is the HAND PLACEMENT (each held room's first `garrison` marks: crew 1, comms 2 at the slits, store 2 at the hatch);
//                   both starts stand out of every watcher's sight or beyond his eye's reach and ten idle seconds pass without a round; the other way in stages;
//                   the yard and the open park read lit off the mains and dark with them out, the watchers' marks dark either way, the lane behind the
//                   signals shelter darker than the open park
//   depot-doors     stack room: on every door of the structure, from the side it is taken from, four stack marks (and a pair's two) on free floor, apart, out
//                   of the opening, clear of the furniture; the clear wall beside each jamb in metres; then live — the four ordered onto every door in turn
//                   get onto their marks
//   depot-openings  THE PUZZLE. The openings of every held room counted off the walls (a walk-through gap, with or without a leaf; a window = anything the eye
//                   passes at 1.5 m and a body does not): the hut has one door and three windows, the store two doors and its hatch. Then the lines, each man
//                   on his mark facing as written: the west slit and a hatch man onto the stack ground outside the crew room's yard door, the other hatch man
//                   onto the battery room's; the east slit onto a metre or so in the MIDDLE of the walk from the park wall's gap to the generator room's door
//                   (the gap and the door's step unseen, no way round the stretch he sees). The nests cover each other: the west slit sees the lane along the
//                   south bar's yard wall as far as the hatch's jamb, a hatch man the ground under the hut's south window. THE STORES' WAY (main gate → along
//                   the south wall, behind the truck → the workshop's yard door → the bay → the store's bay door): the hatch men see none of it, the west
//                   slit sees the stack ground at the workshop's door (the price), and inside the bay nobody does. The generator room and the hut's own door
//                   are seen by neither hut man looking out of his slit; a man just inside the store's bay door by the hatch's west man not at all and by
//                   its east man at his elbow.
//   DEPOT_BREAK=1   each watcher read off the middle of his room, not his mark: depot-openings AND depot-stage must FAIL
//   depot-walk      Sam walks every room and through every door with the four following: man-frames stuck, frames with two men in one place, man-seconds
//                   stood in a doorway, how far the file strings out — judged against this floor's own measured numbers with a margin
//   depot-run       scripted runs over seeds, the commander a ghost who only gives orders off the menu: the OBVIOUS PLAN (the crew room first, across the lit
//                   yard) by TWO PAIRS, TWO DOORS where a room has two, against ONE STACK through each room's first door. Judged: no run stalls at the cap,
//                   one at least is taken, few orders refused, no teammate down to a teammate. Printed: who wins, teammates lost, seconds, two-door entries
//   depot-home      (by name only, not in the family: it judges nothing) the same runs with ROOMFIGHT.rally off — the defenders kept in their rooms
// The game takes the structure and the team's start from the level it stands on (Level.scenarios.roomClear): nothing here reaches into the game's tables but
// the knobs a probe names, and those are put back.
