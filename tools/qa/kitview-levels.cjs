// THE TEAM & KIT PICTURE, EVERY LEVEL WITH A BLOCK (src/host/kitView.ts `?kitview`, staged from src/host/kitViewPlan.ts's plan — on a bespoke set where the way
// names one: src/host/kitViewSet.ts). The GENERIC rows: nothing here knows a level. What it holds a level-way to is read off the page's own plan
// (`__kitview.plan`: the anchor, the wall, the five places, the floor behind) and the game's own nav grid — so a level gets these rows by carrying a block.
// (The records office's own picture, row by row, is tools/qa/kitview-page.cjs; the plan without a browser is tools/qa/kitview-plan.ts.)
//
// The REAL page in headless Chromium on the software adapter, ONE page at a time, the engine's render stood in for by the world's pack (the picture is not this
// tool's question: nothing here is seen on a GPU), the game's clock run SCALE times faster. Per level-way, a squad of four:
//   · it boots to the loop with a plan, and says what it stands on (the anchor's kind, the set);
//   · THE PLAN HAS NO PROBLEMS (`__kitview.plan.problems`, as the page itself planned the way on the game's own floor: each is printed, any one FAILS the row);
//   · the mission's men (a squad of four; a quiet mission's own — Sam alone, or Sam and his partner) on the plan's places, each on free floor on the team's side of the wall's face, nobody else on the floor;
//   · EVERY TILE — Sam's gun, light, smoke, stun, frag, door charge, wand, camera, 40 mm (the launcher SHOULDERED down the wall and never fired: host/kitView.ts shellRow — on a card with no launcher the gun's row, said), wall charge; a teammate's gun, smoke, stun, frag, door charge — picked from rest:
//     its row begins within FRAMES display frames of the pick — or, where the DIRECTOR SAYS it kept the row back (`__kitview.held`), after the picture's
//     own wait. THE WORD MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE DELAY, frame by frame — it is no pass by being there: (1) it is THIS row's word (the begun beat's number,
//     its member, its thing — or the gun's row the director began for that thing, `refused` naming it; a new pick drops the word of one that never
//     began); (2) the frames the page WORKED from the pick to the row's first, less the frames the director names a rule for, are FRAMES at most — a
//     frame the director ran and named nothing for is the row's own lateness, as before the word existed (display frames the page passed over whole —
//     the pace on a slow machine, `__kitview.pace.every`: every second, every third — are held to that pace, and FRAMES); (3) every rule is one this
//     tool knows, with ITS bound: `mend` (what the last row broke hung / staged again under the dissolve) is the old bound outright — FRAMES frames of
//     it at most, and a row held by nothing else begins within FRAMES display frames of the pick, as tools/qa/kitview-page.cjs asks of a restage
//     (`began.frames <= 4`); `home` (the men walking home for a row of Sam's), `sam` (his half step home), `leaf` (not yet to), `arrive` (a card
//     switch's walk): WAIT_MS on the wall clock from the pick; (4) the whole is within WAIT_MS — (a row the way cannot play — no leaf, a blank wall, no stretch to breach — is the GUN's row with
//     the reason kept: said, and a pass), and ends with every man home on his place and the world whole (the leaf hung and to, a wall anchor standing, no
//     charge left set, nobody hurt, no dissolve up) inside ROW_MS;
//     (a way anchored on a BLANK WALL: a row that needs an opening blows the wall charge on the span first and the hole is kept — 'the world whole' is then
//     the wall open at its hole and nothing else; the wall charge's own tile stands it again);
//     (a pick is a MESSAGE: the loop's own next turn of the old tile may begin on a frame before the page hears it. The row waited for is the first begun
//      after the pick was HEARD; the turn begun in between is said, and held to: cut by the pick, no mark made, nothing left set, nobody off his place);
//     and a wall anchor's flag and its wall never disagree: `hole` exactly when the span is open on the nav grid;
//   · A WALL SPAN, the light, then the gun, then the light again: the gun's burst goes through the kept hole and the SECOND light plays through that same hole —
//     no charge again, no restage, the wall never stood again under it (a mend that stood the wall with the flag still up lit a blank wall);
//   · A WALL SPAN, the wall charge's own tile with its STAND-CLEAR gate held shut (`__kitview.standClear` off: the tool's own switch): the charge comes down
//     unblown under the dissolve, the wall standing — and on the loop's next turn of that tile nobody walks out again: the gun's row, `refused` saying why;
//   · THE LAST TEAMMATE'S CARD opened too (one pick: his gun's row): with it over no two men stand within 0.5 m of each other — the fourth man of four has a
//     place of his own by Sam's jamb while his card is open;
//   · A TEAMMATE'S STUN AND HIS FRAG ARE THROWN where the plan says the way has a throw (a door or a gap with the floor behind it: no "no room … for a throw"
//     among the plan's problems): the row's own mark ('bang' / 'frag': the door tools counted it) — or the picture said why not (`refused` naming the tile:
//     an order refused at its start is the gun's row, above). A row that ends 'lost' with nothing thrown and nothing said FAILS (it passed);
//   · what was thrown came to rest BEYOND the anchor's line (through the opening, or the hole) and hurt nobody;
//   · ON A SET OF A QUIET MISSION OR THE SOLO NIGHT the men are dressed as that mission dresses them (main.ts: host/kitViewSet.ts kitViewSetDress → setSuitAs):
//     the sneaking suit on every man of a quiet mission, on Sam of the solo night — read off `__charmat`. A loud mission's set, a level's own way and
//     LOOK=plain: said, nothing judged. (Where the rifle hangs is not read on the page: tools/qa/kitview-plan.ts G holds it headless.)
//   · NO LOOSE PROP THE PLAN HIDES STILL STANDS (`plan.hiddenProps` against the game's own props): as the page comes up, after the mend that follows a gun's
//     burst (the mend puts every prop back on its rest pose: the child must take the plan's away again), and at the end. No prop hidden: true of nothing, and said;
//   · the gun's burst hurt no man of the team;
//   · a row CUT mid-way by another pick leaves every man home and the world whole;
//   · THE PICTURE RAISED NO ALARM: the level's devices sense nothing (host/kitView.ts kitViewInert — the game's own two switches), no device reported, the
//     floor never went up, no alarm was placed — LATCHED ON EVERY DISPLAY FRAME (`__kvAlarm`) and judged IN EVERY TILE'S ROW, then once more over the whole
//     run — AND THE PARK HAD NOTHING TO PUT RIGHT (`__kitview.roused`, the child's own running count of the level's men its park found roused and of
//     the alarm's marks it dropped: the park calms the men and drops the marks before this tool's eye opens, so a man stirred by sight or any road but
//     his ears is read by that count alone — it rose under a row: that row FAILS; it is not 0 at the end, or the page does not say it: the run's row FAILS): every restage goes through the encounter's restart, which clears the devices' log, the floor and the placed alarm, so one reading at the end saw
//     only what happened after the LAST restage. (A report made and cleared between two display frames is still not seen: the frame is the tool's eye.);
//   · HOUR=<id> ONLY — THE PHOTOCELL, ON THE PAGE (`hour=<id>` put on the link in place of the mission's own; no HOUR: no such row). Judged where the page's
//     own hour has the level's outside lamps out (`__hour.table[__hour.id].lamps` false: midday, overcast) and the plan stands under the open sky: the porch
//     lamp is DISABLED and its glowing box is NOT among the world's statics (`__kitview.lamps.porch`, `__kitview.fixtureUp` — a way that writes
//     `light.porch.day`: the lamp burns at that, said), and every lamp of the way's OWN (its set's `lights`, its `add.lamps`; less its `dayLights`, the
//     group `exterior` and a lamp under a cover — a set's: worked out HERE from the set's own boxes, the plan's test written out; an added lamp's: the
//     child's own list `__kitview.dayOut`, which must be said) is out at the game's own switch with its fixture box dark. An hour that burns its lamps (night, dawn, dusk), a way under a roof:
//     said, NOTHING JUDGED. An hour the page did not take: FAIL. This is the row that fails when the child's photocell line is deleted or main.ts's
//     `lampsOut` is inverted — tools/qa/kitview-plan.ts holds only the pure rule and the headless switch.

// says it (`__kitview.quiet`: null on a loud link or with the switch off) and two rows are added on a quiet kind (one on a loud kind: the page says nothing of it):
//   · STAGED — the pool lamp is a lamp of the game's own list, lit, over the glowing box on the wall; Sam is down on his rest place with his gun put away,
//     a partner behind him; the leaf rests a hand ajar; with `FLAGS=kitloud` the row instead holds that the page says NOTHING of it (the old picture);
//   · THE GUN — Sam's weapon tile fires exactly ONE round, the lamp is out by it ('shot', 'dark'), the room is staged again once, and after it the lamp
//     burns and he is down again with the gun away.
// ROWS WHOSE MEANING MOVED on a quiet kind with the switch on (a loud kind, and `kitloud`: every row as it was):
//   · 'each on a place of the plan' / 'every man home': the places are the ones the men are STAGED on (`__kitview.plan.slots`: Sam's rest by the pool and
//     the partner's behind him, his own card open the plan's place at the door) — not the plan's first places;
//   · 'the world whole': the leaf HUNG is the leaf at its REST angle — a hand ajar there, shut everywhere else (`leaf.ajar` is measured from it);
//   · Sam's 'weapon' row: its end is the room staged again (one restart more) and not the gun lowered; 'the gun's burst hits no man' counts its one round;
//   · the 'cut' row: the tile that cuts the smoke is the lamp's row — it too ends in a restage.
//   · LOUD KIT'S COST (KIT_VIEW_QUIET.cost, `__kitview.cost`): a loud tile's row that went off is answered from inside before the picture settles — one row
//     more on every kind holds it: on a quiet kind each such row was answered (the room at full, the leaf thrown wide, Sam up) and the room staged again
//     after it; with `kitloud`, and on a loud kind, none ever played. 'every man home and the world whole' is unmoved: it is read once the cost's own
//     restage has settled (`__kitview.settled` is false while a cost is up).
//   · LIFE AT REST (KIT_VIEW_QUIET.idle, `__kitview.life`): one row more on a quiet kind — a beat begins at rest and a pick under it is on time (the pick's
//     own row is judged as every pick's is); with `kitloud`, and on a loud kind, the cost's row also holds that no beat ever began. THE BEAT IS OFF AS
//     SHIPPED (`idle.on` false): a row before it holds that none began over the run nor at rest, and this row raises the switch for itself (`idleOn`).
//   · 'every man home' at the end of a TEAMMATE's row is judged by HOME_M for Sam as for every man: his rest place is a body's width nearer the door
//     since the re-shoot (KIT_VIEW_QUIET.samAlong 1.1), where a partner working the door shouldered him — so he gives way FIRST, a step back along the
//     wall as the partner's card opens (`stepBack`; `__kitview.quiet.place` is his place as the open card has it).
