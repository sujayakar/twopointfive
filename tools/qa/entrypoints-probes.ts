// The 'entrypoints' family: ENTRY POINTS STAY OFF UNCLEARED OPENINGS (game/entrypoints.ts; the footage page: "a man standing still within about 3 m of an
// opening an enemy gets the first look through" — both operator deaths in the hostage-rescue video).
//   entrypoints-known   the tracker: a side of an opening is known once one of the squad has stood on it with a line to it, in a doorway both; nothing known
//                       through a wall or from too far; a restart forgets it.
//   entrypoints-count   THE COUNT, across the seven start-card scenarios: every entry of every held room, taken from outside by that scenario's squad as if
//                       it were the first door of the run (known ground = the stack's own marks and nothing else: the worst case), its points of domination
//                       as they were against as they are now — how many stand within ENTRY.nearM and in the line of an opening nobody has been beyond.
//                       Holds: fewer after than before in total and never more on any door; every point left risky is one the room has no floor for (the
//                       same search finds none); every moved point is on free floor, inside the room, clear of the other points, walkable from the door,
//                       no further than ENTRY.moveM from where it was and not risky. Printed, not judged: the threshold stage's shallow step and the
//                       stack's own marks, which this change leaves where they were.
//   entrypoints-off     ENTRY.offOpenings off: pods() answers the old points, object for object, on every door of every scenario; and a seeded entry on
//                       the manager's door plays the same game with the switch off as the tracker alone leaves it (digest for digest).
//   bun run tools/qa/entrypoints-probes.ts table      the count's rows as markdown (the page's table)
// The same-seed play-through numbers (points dealt in play, deaths at such points) are tools/qa/playthrough.ts's: RunOut.entry and Death.open.
// ENTRYOFF_BREAK=1 = entrypoints-off's run without the tracker plays with the switch on: must fail on both stands.
// entrypoints-count is RED ON BOTH STANDS by a row of tools/qa/expected-red.ts (11-06): one moved point of the killhouse's bunks, its watch point out of his line.
