// EVERY ROOM THE DEFENDERS CAN SHUT HAS ANOTHER WAY IN (the maintainer, 10-11, on the barricading: "i worry that it effectively requires the player to blow
// open the door with a door charge or 40mm. maybe we just need to design levels so there's always another route in? and then the gameplay element is trying to
// surprise the enemies from an entrance or window they don't expect?").
//
// What the defenders can do (src/game/digin.ts, asked here through the game's own predicates — nothing is re-derived): a room of the room fight (roomfight.ts
// roomAt: the floor reached without crossing a door) has its doors as ENTRIES; a man whose room it is hauls furniture to a door and wedges it when the door is
// `wedgeable` (not steel, not locked in the level file, no keypad), when the wedge HOLDS (doors.ts wedgeHolds: the leaf opens toward him), when his squad may
// (enemysquads.ts: a squad's `barricade` list — as shipped; `--nolists` asks it as one pool or a last stand would have it: any door), and while his room has
// wedged fewer than DIGIN.wedges doors.
//
// THE QUESTION is the squad's WALK IN FROM OUTSIDE, not one room's doors: with every room that has men in it (a room the level's structure names, or one a
// defender stands in as any of the level's missions is staged, or a rescue's data may deal one into: every roamer mark counts) wedging what it can — all of its doors that open into it when those are DIGIN.wedges or fewer,
// ANY DIGIN.wedges of them when there are more, every choice tried — is each such room still reached from the team's start and the ground round the place
// (floor that runs to the edge of the map, or 600 m² and over) without a charge or a 40 mm? Two rooms that each keep 'another door' which only joins them
// to each other are both shut, and the check says so. A WEDGE SHUTS A DOOR ONE WAY: it is locked against the face away from the man who set it, so
// nobody comes INTO his room by it, and from inside his room it is pulled open by hand. WHAT FOLLOWS: a room passes by a door that opens OUT of it (its
// own men cannot wedge that; the neighbours' wedge on it stops only the walk the other way) from floor the squad reaches, by a window from such floor,
// or by more doors than wedges.
// Furniture is not asked for (a wedge needs a piece in reach; furniture moves and a level gains it): the cautious answer.
//   door     a door no room has wedged that the squad can open: by hand, the pick or the boot — not locked steel (no pick, boot or charge shifts it), and a
//            keypad's bolt only from the face a boot drives it from
//   window   a pane of glass with floor on both faces that a round opens and a man walks through (bottom under 0.2 m, top at 1.85 m or over, not laminated,
//            not solid glass, and the player's own circle walked across it with the pane out) — Sam's feet and everybody's rounds; the nav grid has no way
//            through a broken pane, so teammates shoot through it and come in by a door
//   wall     ONLY on a level whose structure ISSUES wall charges for the run (scenarios.roomClear.wallCharges — the clinic, whose one idea is that the walls
//            are the way in): a place on a wall of the room where a wall charge is accepted from floor already reached. Those charges are the level's own
//            issue, on top of the kit. On every other level a wall charge spends one of the kit's, so it is listed (`--walls`), never counted.
//
//   bun run tools/qa/second-way-check.ts [level.json …] [--list] [--walls] [--nolists] [--verbose]     exit 0 = every such room is reached, 1 = a FAIL line,
//                                                                                                       2 = an unknown flag or level (nothing ran)

//   bun run tools/qa/probes.ts secondway   (family `missions`; run in a process of its own)
// It stands AS SHIPPED whatever TPS_PROFILE says: which way a door opens is dealt under the page's door rules — on the frozen stand every leaf swings both
// ways, a wedge holds any of them, and the check would have nothing to say. A stand word in the caller's environment that takes the page's door rules or
// its breaking glass away (ONEWAY=0, QA_EXITSOUT=1, GLASSFX=off, GLASSBREAK=off …) is not the game the question is about: the check says so and exits 2.
// LIMITS: who stands where and where the team starts are taken together over a level's mission kinds (only the office has more than one, and it has no
// room to mend); a window counts only where glass breaks (the page as shipped: chaos over 0, the glass switches on).
// A NEW LEVEL is checked the day it has a row in scenarioList.ts (SCENARIOS, squad rows); before that: `second-way-check.ts <file>.json`.
// THE MENDS, when a room fails: hang one of its doors — one that leads to floor the squad reaches — to open OUT of it (`swing` on the level's door: no wedge
// inside holds it, and a wedge the neighbours set on it stops only the walk INTO their room), or give it a window a man steps through (an opening from under WINDOW_SILL up to WINDOW_HEAD
// or over — and under 1.9 m, or door-size.ts reads it as a doorway without a leaf — glass 'whole', wide enough not to be laminated: the kill house's `port`).
