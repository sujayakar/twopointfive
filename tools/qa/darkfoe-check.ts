// AN ENEMY ON ALERT DOES NOT SIT BLIND IN THE DARK — the check behind src/game/darkfoe.ts (DARKFOE.on: on in the page, ?nodarkfoe; off on the frozen stand,
// TPS_DARKFOE=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/darkfoe-check.ts        (also `probes.ts darkfoe`; run it on BOTH stands: plain, and with TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front)
// Mousehole's room clear at night (where the maintainer's tape was played: nine defenders, weapon lights dealt off, some rooms lit and some not), Sam out of
// everybody's sight, the switch and the numbers thrown by hand. "Gunfire has reached him" is written into a man's witness record in (a)-(c), (e), (g) — no
// event, so dig-in and the squads sleep and the lamp rule is read alone — and is REAL gunfire (eight 'shot' events where Sam stands) in (d), where they wake:
//   (a) nobody has been told: with the rule on, six seconds in, no man knows, no lamp burns and nobody has left his mark — though some of them are blind;
//   (b) every man carries a light and all have been told: the module's reading of each man's view is the check's own (the same floor read again here); a man
//       whose view has read dark for the dwell burns his lamp and one whose view has read lit for the dwell does not — both really happen; a burning lamp lights
//       the floor down his aim (the estimate with it against without it); no lamp moves twice inside the hold, nor more than six times a minute;
//   (c) the lamps are the word: ONE man told, the rest not — a man who has only the word has a burning lamp of his side before his eyes (inside his cone, a
//       clear line), at least one such man lights his own, and the word never becomes knowing for good; with `byLamp` off nobody else has it and no other lamp burns;
//   (d) nobody carries a light, real gunfire. No authored floor is counted on to hold a walker (the levels are rebuilt under this check), so the walk is
//       read on a floor THE CHECK SETS: once the shots have died away every fixture is shot out and one ceiling lamp is put up in the own room of a man the
//       room fight merely has holding, 4 m or more from him (the first of killhouse / hall / depot where the rule's own search finds him a spot); then on
//       depot.json as it is dealt, and on Mousehole (stay-home squads: dig-in has them). No lamp of a man's burns; every man sent was alert already, was
//       nobody else's the frame before (darkFoeKept null), stood on floor with no light in view, and was sent to floor he can see from INSIDE HIS OWN ROOM; the
//       man the lamp was set for is sent; at no more than the stumbling pace, and those who got there are the room fight's again (holding, pinned); nobody is
//       sent more than `moves` times; on Mousehole a blind man dig-in has is never sent; on depot.json `roam` lets a man out of his room (at least one goes)
//       and sends no fewer; with `seek` off nobody walks on the set floor; the mission's alert count is the same whichever way;
//   (h) only suspicious: a blind man held suspicious by hand (he has heard something, found nobody) for eight seconds never lights his lamp and never knows for
//       good; with `suspect` on (the first cut) the same man lights it;
//   (e) not this rule's: a man the mission dealt a burning light, and every man under a show, is never met;
//   (f) the per-man state round-trips darkFoeSnapshot / darkFoeRestore;
//   (g) the switch off = the base: nobody is met, nothing is asked, no lamp burns, and thirty seeded seconds with every man told digest as the stand that never
//       had the rule on.
// DARKFOE_BREAK=1 = the rule left on for the 'off' lines, and `suspect` left on for (h)'s: (g) and (h) must fail.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: every light here is guards.ts's direct-light estimate (no bounce — it errs dark). Nobody has seen any of this on a GPU.
