// micromanaging > autopilot commanding > doing it yourself' · 'so there's incentive to go beyond just mashing b').
//   bun run tools/qa/command-tally.ts                                             every hand on every default level over seeds 1‥6, the table, a verdict

//   bun run tools/qa/command-tally.ts --trace plan:killhouse-four:3               one run in this process with its timeline (--one is the same for a worker: one `@@<json>` line)
//   --mortal                                                                      Sam goes down when his hits are spent, and the run ends there
//   CT_NOTOOLS=1  the plan hand picks no entry by hand (two doors only) · CT_ANYDOOR=1  it takes a second door over floor nobody has walked (both: env)
//   exit 0 = the order holds (the verdict, below) · 1 = it does not · 2 = a bad flag, nothing run
//
// THE STAND: the page as it opens (TPS_PROFILE=shipped is set here when the caller did not), so B is the autopilot (autopilot.ts) and X lays the plan
// (planlay.ts). Sam is seen through the CPU estimate of the light on him (rescue-tally.ts's stand-in) and shot at in every hand; by default he does
// not go DOWN (god mode, as the maintainer often plays) and every ROUND that hits him is counted instead (the caller of his flinch is combat.ts's
// samHit; a stagger, a dazzle or a blast plays the same flinch and is counted apart, as `blasts` — his own squad's cans among them, and so is a frag
// that would have killed him: god mode hides which). `lives` = how many times a mortal Sam would have gone down (player.hitsLeft rounds each, one
// on the page today; the two seconds after a down count nothing). A CLEAN floor = taken with no such down: what a player who can be hit calls a win.
// --mortal: he goes down, and the run ends there.
// THE THREE HANDS — test drivers only. What a hand TELLS the game goes through the real keys and the real cursor (W A S D, the left button, the use
// key on a locked door, B, T, X and its digits, F); what it tidies behind itself does not (it closes a menu it could not use and drops a plan it gave
// up on by the order book's own calls).
//   solo   the squad is never told anything (it stands where the mission put it). Sam takes every held room himself: to the door, through it, and to
//          each man in it (he shoots only a man the fog shows, on screen, on a clear line, `react` seconds after he shows — rescue-tally.ts's eyes).
//   b      B and nothing else. From the first step that has the held room's nearest door in the picture: the cursor on it and B (stack up) — the men
//          go first and he walks behind them to a spot beside the door's own wall (B on himself, fall in, only when the door is too far to point
//          at). When they stand on their marks B again (the squad picks its entry); a door found shut gets B again. Then he walks in behind them.
//   plan   the same walk, but the entry is his where he has one to give:
//          · TWO DOORS, ONE WORD where the room has a second door that is not locked, within 30 m on foot, reached over floor the team has already
//            stood on (cleared.ts — a pair is not sent alone through rooms nobody has been in) and both pairs have a man up: T to red, X on the near
//            door, the tools page, 'wait for my word', the entry (a stun while the squad has more than one, else open and clear) — laid; T to blue,
//            'open and clear' laid on the far door; F sends the plan, and F again when both pairs stand set is the one word.
//          · else A TOOL OF HIS OWN PICKING on B's stack: a frag while the squad has one (B never throws one), else the last stun (B keeps its last).
//          · else the b hand's B.
//   AFTER THE ROOMS every hand hunts whoever is left: solo walks to him; a commander falls in, walks until the man's floor is in the picture and gives
//   B on that floor. A commander whose squad is all down goes on ALONE, as the solo hand would (the game does not end the mission there either).
//   SAM'S RIFLE is the same in all three: he shoots whoever the picture shows him.
// WHAT IS COUNTED per level and hand: floors taken, CLEAN floors, floors the squad was wiped on, floors not taken in the time, teammates lost, Sam's
// would-be downs, and the clock (mean over the floors taken). And THE PAIRED ROOMS: the plan hand and the b hand are one script until the first room
// the plan hand sets out to take its own way, so that room is met in the same state by both; it is booked by what the hand SET OUT to do, whatever
// became of the try (a plan dropped under fire, a tool refused, the squad lost on the walk all stay in the table).
// THE VERDICT: a laid plan over B = at least as many clean floors AND fewer men lost a floor; B over solo = more clean floors.
// WHAT IT CANNOT SAY. No GPU: no light meter but the estimate, no smoke, no feel. A bot's hands are not a person's. Every hand knows which rooms are
// held and walks to the men left in them through the fog (all three alike; solo leans on it most); none knows how many are behind a door. It orders
// the three against each other on game logic; whether each is FUN is a call for a person at the keys.
