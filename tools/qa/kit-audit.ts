// WHO CARRIES WHAT, ON EVERY MISSION (a listing, not a check: it always exits 0).

//   bun run tools/qa/kit-audit.ts            (markdown on stdout; --deal=off prints the cards of the build before the deal — src/game/kit.ts KITDEAL — and --more=off those of the deal alone, before its key `more`)
//
// The squad's kit is ONE table for every level (src/game/kit.ts ISSUED, src/game/slots.json's named kits): a level changes it only by carrying a block of
// its own (`scenarios.issue.members`) or wall charges of its own (`scenarios.roomClear.wallCharges`). So this prints the table once — every squad kit at
// every team size, each man's pouches, who comes with nothing — and then one row a mission with what its level adds or asks: the sizes it offers, whether
// the cards can be changed there, its own issue, its locked and steel doors against the charges the squad brings, and whether frags can be ordered at all
// (never with a hostage, the man a snatch came for, or a civilian in the blast: src/game/squadthrow.ts). A level's author reads his row.
