// THE LIGHTS GO OUT AND SOMEBODY GOES TO PUT THEM BACK ON — the check behind src/game/powerout.ts (POWEROUT.on: on in the page, ?nopowerout; off on the frozen
// stand, TPS_POWEROUT=1).
//   bun run tools/qa/powerout-check.ts        (also `probes.ts powerout`; run it on BOTH stands: plain, and with TPS_PROFILE=shipped in front)
// A room clear staged as the mission deals it, the team left standing on its start marks, Sam out of everybody's sight, the mains thrown by hand. The switch is
// thrown by the check; so are the dialogue pass and the teammates' work rule (a frozen stand without them hands the stock errand to one of Sam's own men, who
// walks into the house: another check's business). Read on the first of LEVELS where a PAIR goes (the levels are rebuilt under this check: no floor is counted on):
//   (a) a calm garrison: their word is on the net before any man of theirs has left his post, and the first step comes `beat` after it; no more than `men` go;
//       every man who left his post is one the timeline sent; nobody else stirs (the posted men keep their posts); every room that had a man keeps one; the men
//       out file boots for the team's ears and burn their lamps while the mains are down; a man of theirs is at the lever when the mains come back, later than
//       the word by the lever's own fumble; every man out is back on the post he left, holding it as he held it;
//   (b) the lights go a second time: nobody walks out again — one line, and the word is out (powerOutWord);
//   (c) the garrison already knows (gunfire written into one man's witness record): nobody leaves, one line, the word is out;
//   (d) the breaker shot to scrap: a man gets to it, says so, the word is out, the mains stay down and every man out is back on his post;
//   (e) a fight while they are out (real gunfire where Sam stands): no man of the party is the rule's any more inside three seconds, and none stands at the lever;
//   (f) the state round-trips powerOutSnapshot / powerOutRestore in the middle of a walk;
//   (g) the breaker in a defender's own room (the first of LEVELS where the timeline says so): one man goes, and he never leaves that room;
//   (i) no bulb in any man's view but a lit floor in one's (the glasshouse, its one bare bulb put out first): he notices `darkAfter` after the trip by the floor;
//   (j) every mains-fed light already out: nobody knows, nothing is said, nobody leaves his post;
//   (k) the first man dazzled when the beat is up: the second walks to the lever in his place; (l) the first man put down without a sound: his mate says so;
//   (m) a lone man put down the same way: no word until he is overdue, then one line; (n) the switch thrown off under a walk: the men out go back to their posts;
//   (h) the switch off = the base: no line, nobody leaves his post, the mains stay down, and thirty seeded seconds digest as the stand that never had the rule on.
// POWEROUT_BREAK=1 = `beat` thrown to nothing for (a) and the rule left on for (h): (a) and (h) must fail.   exit 0 = all hold · 1 = one does not
// THE HARNESS HAS NO GPU: a lamp here is a light the CPU's estimate counts, a line on the net is a string. Nobody has seen or heard any of this in play.
