// TUT-QUEUE — the tutorial's fourth mission, "The relay post, in pairs": ONE WALLED POST THAT ONE ORDER TO EVERYBODY CANNOT TAKE, AND HE IS ON ITS FLOOR
// WITH HIS FOUR. Every stop is a thing the squad as one group loses and the squad as two pairs wins, and the only new thing in his hands is Shift held
// with the command key: a part of the squad takes the new order and the rest go on as they were (game/planmode.ts planGoal). The word's key then sends
// everything that waits. Nobody could say that of another level: here every room has two doors and every fight comes from two sides at once.
// (The maintainer, 10-26: "then we have a level that teaches queueing commands" — after the missions that taught him his own body, the squad's key and
// the word, and his kit and theirs. The floor is the plan mode mission's, tools/levels/tut-plan.ts, copied here and not imported: that mission was led
// from above with nobody of his on the floor, and goes out with plan mode.)

// THE HAND PLACEMENT, AND WHY
//   · the guardroom is the EASY room with two doors on two walls: the first split is only the mechanics — the key on one door, Shift with the key on
//     the other, one word — and it wins because two men cannot watch two doors.
//   · the hall is the room one stack loses. Its gun sits behind bags at the far end and looks down the room's length at the front door: men who come in
//     by it are taken from the side. The back door is at the gunner's shoulder. A pair on each, sent by one word, and the gun is turned to the wrong door.
//   · then more come, by the two gates at once: Shift with the key on one gate and then on the other, and the squad parts to watch both from behind the
//     bags he has walked them to. A spot to watch is the same pair of keys as a second door, and two gates are the reason to want two of them.
//   · HE AND THE FOUR START inside the track gate by their truck, behind blocks no door and no gate of the post has a line to.
