// THE FIRST TUTORIAL MISSION: a squad led from above (levels/tut-sky.json; `bun run tools/levels/export.ts tut-sky`), on a place made for it:
// THE TUNNEL STATION. The road over the pass goes into the mountain here, and the men who keep the tunnel open in winter live beside its mouth: one long
// range under the cut rock (the tea room, the kitchen, the store), a bunkhouse across the yard on the road, a court behind it for the generator and the fuel,
// and a wide yard between them where the plough lorry stands by the grit heap. One gate onto the road.
// THE SENTENCE NOBODY COULD SAY OF ANOTHER LEVEL: the road ends in a hole in the mountain with a gun truck's lamps in front of it, and the only way off the
// road is the station's gate.
// THE PLAYER IS NOBODY ON THE FLOOR: he is over the squad, and all he has is the view and the squad's command key. So everything here is laid out to be read
// from above, with room for four men wherever four men are sent: a road long enough to look down, a gateway three metres wide, a yard nine metres deep, rooms
// seven metres deep with their doors on the walls the view looks at, and two metres of plain wall on each side of every door.
// FOUR BEATS, one new thing at a time (game/rails.ts locks the rest; levels/tut-sky.script.ts stages the fire):
//   the road      the squad is behind its two pickups under fire from the roadblock at the tunnel's mouth. Turn the view, zoom it, shift it; then the
//                 command key on the yard takes the squad through the gate under its own smoke, and the roadblock comes for the gate.
//   indoors       what is behind a door is not known until it opens (the fog of war is on from the first step). The command key on a door stacks them; the
//                 word sends them in. Twice: the tea room, the kitchen.
//   the wall      the orders' menu: a charge on the store's wall from the kitchen, and the word blows it.
//   the dark      the command key on the mains box sends a man to throw it: every lamp on the mains goes, the station's emergency beacons turn red over the
//                 snow, and the bunkhouse sends two men across the yard behind their torches. Night vision; the last room taken in the dark; back to the trucks.
// Nobody is lost: a teammate who would go down is on a knee for a few seconds (rails.respawn). The checkpoints are the beats' first steps and no others.
// THE HAND PLACEMENT: every room's marks are exactly its garrison (the page deals a room's men from its marks: with no spare mark every try is this one).
// Nobody stands at a window and every window is shuttered for the storm: the yard is safe ground once the gate is held, and each room is met at its door.

// a wall, never within 1.4 m of a door), caps on the tops of things, trodden paths, ruts. What FALLS is the weather's (src/game/weatherKinds.ts, by name).
// THE LIGHT: a thin moon on snow and pools of warm light. ON THE MAINS (the generator in the court; the box on the kitchen's yard wall throws them all): the
// bulbs of the four rooms, the lamps over the kitchen's and the bunkhouse's doors, the lamp over the gate, the lamps of the tunnel's mouth, the light behind
// the shutters. ON THEIR OWN FUEL: the brazier in the yard, two stoves, the bread oven, the lanterns, the gun truck's head lamps. ON A BATTERY, and only when
// the mains are out: five red beacons (the yard wall, the bunkhouse, the gate, the tea room, the tunnel's mouth).
