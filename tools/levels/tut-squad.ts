//
// THE HAND PLACEMENT, AND WHY
//   · the guard hut and the store are the two EASY rooms, door to door across the street: one man, then two, each on the mark a door's first man sees.
//   · the workshop has TWO doors on opposite walls. The one that faces the guard hut across the lane between them STANDS OPEN on the tutorial's rails
//     (the level's script swings it in), and its man holds that doorway from the far end of the room. Once the store has fallen he puts rounds out of
//     it onto the hut's wall, where the squad went in first: he, the doorway and his rounds are all there to be
//     looked at from the street in front of the workshop, where a step walks the player. The answer is
//     the side door, at his back, and the way to it is along the street: no part of it is in the line of the doorway he holds.
//   · THE WALL stands across the street: everything west of it is out of the nest's sight, so the first three rooms are learnt with no gun on them. The only
//     way on is round its end, and there the gun looks straight down the street. Rounds past the gunner's head put it down; while it is down a man can make
//     the blocks. The nest is open to the sky: what finishes it is a grenade over the bags.
//   · the hall's door is locked and nobody was issued a charge for it. It is on the far face, in the passage past the nest, so nobody stands at it
//     while the nest is being fought. Its two men stand in the corners of the door's own wall, where the doorway shows nothing and a man who walks in
//     is between them; the one street window looks straight at both. So the room is cleared from outside, through the open window, and only then is the leaf
//     kicked in and walked through.
//   · the picket comes by two gates at once: one man by the road gate, in front; two by the back gate, down the alley, behind whoever is still looking at
//     the road. Who comes: the post's own picket, camped up the road (the mast in the yard is what calls it).
