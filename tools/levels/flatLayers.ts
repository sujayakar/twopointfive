// FLAT DECALS IN ORDER — the heights of the look's floor decals, so the picture can tell which lies on which.
//
// The fault (the maintainer, 10-11, on the block: "also seeing some zorder issues on the floor in the screenshot"): the skins told two decals that cross apart
// by 20 µm of height (`+ (n % 100) * 0.00002`). The depth buffer cannot: depth32float, near 0.5 m, far 120 m, near → 0 (src/math/vec.ts perspective) holds
// about 1.2e-7 × z² metres a step at z metres from the camera — 52 µm at the camera's own 21 m, 190 µm zoomed out to 40. Two paints 20 µm apart share a depth
// there and every pixel of the overlap goes to whichever the rasteriser's rounding favours: a cover plate through its chamber's rim, a ring through a trench.
// The look had only ever been drawn on the software adapter; it was first seen on a GPU.
//
// The rule: where two flat decals of DIFFERENT paint overlap on the plan, the upper one's top face is at least `FLAT_STEP` above the lower one's — about
// ten depth steps at 21 m seen from the camera's pitch, three at 40 (and small enough that no decal's centre crosses a centimetre: a checkpoint's level
// fingerprint, rust/game_rules/src/tick/savestate, is the same before and after). Which is the upper one is what the skin wrote (the higher top; the later one where they tie). Two of the SAME paint are left
// alone: whichever wins a pixel, it is the same pixel — so a path's joints and a ring's corners do not climb a step each. Nothing is moved that did not have
// to be, and nothing is moved down.
