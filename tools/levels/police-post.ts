// THE DISTRICT POLICE POST — a level for one man sneaking: a walled mud-brick post at night, a main building of seven rooms off one corridor, a generator
// shed, a guard hut at the gate, two pickups under a tin canopy, a radio mast behind the radio room and an impound of seized vehicles down the east wall.
// No story: a place, a thing to take, a way out. Six beats are authored; a run mans five of them (the plain file mans all six).
//   bun run tools/levels/export.ts police-post      → levels/police-post.json (its footstep `surfaces`, its scenarios.quiet block; no room clear in it)
//   bun run tools/qa/quiet-check.ts police-post.json  the quiet block against the built floor, every deal started
//   bun run tools/qa/quiet-light.ts police-post       the light a sneaking man stands in, on paper
//   bun run tools/qa/quiet-plan.ts police-post --png  the plan picture: beats, starts, places, ways out, the cameras' cones
//   bun run tools/qa/solo-night.ts --level police-post.json --quiet --plan careful,sneak,walk --out short --seeds 1-12      the scripted player against it
//   QUIET_VARIANT=1,0,0 bun run tools/levels/export.ts police-post     → levels/police-post-v100.json: ONE deal (spot, patrol set, start), a scratch file
//   page: ?levelFile=police-post.json&quiet   (&quiet=N pins the deal)
//
// THE ONE IDEA — HANDS. Every door that matters is locked, and the only ring of keys is on the desk sergeant's belt. Most men have the armoury pad's four
// digits in their heads (the two hard ones give nothing while calm). Or you kneel four seconds a lock in the corridor, where a man walks. Or the breaker:
// cut the power and the sergeant, the ring on his belt, is the man who walks out to the shed to put it back.
//   · THE LOCKS: the four corridor doors of the rooms worth having — cells, radio room, commander's office, duty room — and the east side door (keyed on
//     its impound face) are on ONE key ('post'), keyed on their outer face (from inside every one of them opens freely). THE ARMOURY HAS NO CORRIDOR DOOR:
//     its doorway is bricked up, and its only door is from the radio room, on a keypad (pad_armoury; it opens INTO the armoury, a thumb-turn on that side).
//     The radio room and the office are joined by a free door. So one lock picked (radio or office) gives two of the three places the thing can be, and
//     the armoury wants the pad's digits on top of that — out of a man's mouth — or a boot on the pad door, which the floor hears.
//   · THE RING: only the desk man's route carries the key (`keys: ['post']`; every other route `keys: []` — staff open every lock whatever they carry, `keys`
//     only decides what a questioned man can hand over). Grab him and ask (Space behind him, then the question row): 'mine's on my belt', and every 'post'
//     door then opens to the player like to staff — no pick, no kneeling. He is behind the counter in the lit duty room 25 s, 14 s at the filing cabinet in its
//     north-west corner with his back to the room (the grab), tries the corridor door's handle, and goes out of the front door for a look at the gate: the front door (free, on the forecourt, under the camera) or the duty room's own
//     bunk-room door (free, from the dark bunk room) is the way to his back.
//   · THE DIGITS: the sentry, the sergeant, the yard man and the generator man give the pad's code when asked (the corridor man and the man off watch are
//     hard: nothing while calm; every set has the sentry and the sergeant). With it the armoury opens from the radio room — itself behind a 'post' lock.
//   · THE CLOCK: a man taken does not answer the net, and is asked after in about a minute. The first pair of hands starts it.

//
// THE WAYS IN (four openings in the wall): the MAIN GATE on the south (3 m, its leaves standing open) under lamp_gate, the guard hut a stride inside it, the
// camera over the front door panning the forecourt; the WEST GATE (a leaf; the yard inside it is dark as far as the porch); the NORTH GATE at the motor
// pool's mouth (a leaf, under lamp_pool and lamp_yard); the EAST GATE, into the impound — the base way out (the engine's exit test faces east).
// THE WAYS THROUGH THE BUILDING: the west porch (an open doorway on the corridor's west end: a look passes it both ways), the front door into the duty room,
// the east side door on the corridor's east end, the store's own door onto the impound, and the commander's office window on the back strip (a look and a
// round pass, a man does not). The dark way to the corridor is the store's door and the store / bunk room, both dark and both free.
// THE THING TO TAKE ('the case file'): the evidence locker in the armoury (under the room's one small lamp, cam_server on it — on its own battery: the
// breaker does not blind it), the commander's safe, or the radio table.
// THE LIGHTS: three yard lamps (lamp_gate over the forecourt, lamp_yard thrown north over the motor pool's mouth, lamp_pool on the north gate), the impound's
// bulb just inside the east gate; ceiling panels lit in the corridor's west end, the duty room, the shed, and one small lamp each over the locker and the
// radio set; dark: cells, bunk, store, office, the corridor's east tube — ALL ON THE MAINS: the breaker takes every one of them and cam_yard. Three battery
// things stay: the hut's lantern, the commander's desk lamp, cam_server. THE BREAKER is on the generator shed's SOUTH wall, inside (on the west wall — the
// perimeter's — the man sent to reset it was sent to a point inside that wall); the shed's door is on the forecourt, and the generator man spends a third of
// his beat in there on two sets of three. A tripped breaker is reset by the nearest calm man: the desk sergeant, ring on his belt, on 10 of 12 moments tried (the generator man when he is out there already) — eleven seconds of dark.
// THE SIX BEATS (POST_ROUTES below, one line each there): yard (the horseshoe round the wall) · gate (the sentry) · corridor (two uneven laps: the east end first, the
// porch, 48 s by his cot; then the lap again and 12 s) · generator (the bunk room ↔ the shed, by the front door) · desk (THE KEYS: the counter, the filing cabinet, the corridor door's handle, a look out of the front
// door) · bunk (the man off watch: a smoke by the impound, the store, the bunk room's stove). THE THREE SETS (QUIET.patrols): the corridor man is on EVERY set (without him
// a blind upright walk finished unseen on 4 seeds of 12) — 0 yard, gate, corridor, generator, desk · 1 yard, gate, corridor, bunk, desk · 2 gate, corridor,
// bunk, generator, desk: everyone is indoors — the yards are free and the building is full.
// DEVICES: cam_yard (over the front door, panning from the yard wall's leaf to the main gate, 12 s a sweep; mains), cam_server (the armoury; battery), pad_armoury (the armoury ↔
// radio door). (The corridor's tripwire is gone: a shin-high laser is not a mud-brick police post's. Nothing replaces it but the corridor man.)
// LANDMARKS: THE MAST (the lattice radio mast and its dish behind the radio room, on the back strip) and THE IMPOUND (the east yard).
// BODY NOOKS (dark with every lamp burning and on nobody's beat; not tried with a body): the cells' anteroom; between the two pickups under the canopy;
// behind the tarped pallets in the yard's north-east corner; the store on set 0.
// REPLAY: three starts (west gate · north wall · east wall), three spots, three exits (east · north · west), three patrol sets.
//
// HOW IT WAS TUNED (tools/qa/solo-night.ts, the scripted player; the level moved, never the tool) — kept from the first build, do not undo blindly:
//   - the lamps (the compound's 260 cd / 65° lit the whole yard: now 120 cd / 34–48°); lamp_yard turned north off the gate → porch line;
//   - the shed's door from its north wall to its east, then the yard wall: the generator man saw the west gate from the forecourt on 9 seeds of 12;
//   - the yard man from a loop through yard_sw to a horseshoe that comes down the west yard in plain view;
//   - the desk man off the corridor (he came out of the duty door beside the armoury's): his key stop is INSIDE the duty room;
//   - the radio man (he lived in two of the three rooms the thing can be in) for the man off watch; the office door hung on its east jamb (the open leaf
//     shut the safe off from the script); the corridor man given his walk FIRST and his rest after, so a blind crossing of the porch meets him.
// Round two (10-10): the armoury's corridor doorway bricked up (hands or a boot, no third way); the corridor man's two uneven laps, the east end first (a blind walk in by the side door met nobody with the doors left open); the sergeant's cabinet
// stop; side_e on the key; cam_yard's sweep; each man of the bunk room a place of his own; the bastion moved off the yard man's line; the blue band.
// The polish pass (10-10): the lock graph and the ring; the corridor man on every set; the impound; the breaker moved; the generator man's and the man off
// watch's waits; the tripwire retired; the whole post rebuilt in the GWOT look kit on the same wall lines, blockers and lights.
//
// LIMITS IT IS BUILT INSIDE: the world is 40 × 28 m, the wall stands on x 4 / 36, z 4 / 24 and the 4 m outside it is the approach. needs.ts NEED_SPOTS and
// qrf.ts QRF_MARKS are the office's coordinates on this base. In the GWOT look kit (src/scene/gwotKit.ts). Units: metres. +X east, +Z south, +Y up.
// NOT SEEN DRAWN: laid out on paper and checked headless (validator, level-lint, quiet-check, quiet-light, the scripted solo night); nobody has looked at it on a GPU.
