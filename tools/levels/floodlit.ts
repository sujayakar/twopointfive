// THE FLOODLIT YARD — one idea: OWN THE DARK (levels/floodlit.json ← bun run tools/levels/export.ts floodlit). A walled compound on an overcast night. The
// team forms up outside the wall, in the dim edge of the gate posts' lamps (lived things: below); between the gate and the building lie eleven metres of open yard under three floodlights on the building's
// eaves, and the rooms' open windows look straight down it at the gate. The floodlights and every bulb in the building hang on the MAINS; the mains breaker
// is in the generator shed on the OUTSIDE of the west wall, a short walk from the start to a door with a lamp over it. Throw it (Sam's own row, or the squad's 'work' order
// on the panel) and the yard is black: the defenders carry no lights and no goggles, the team has goggles. NOBODY COMES TO PUT THE LIGHTS BACK ON: a room
// clear pins its defenders to their marks (lighting.ts hands one of them the errand and he says so; he does not walk). THE SHED IS EMPTY ON PURPOSE: with
// one of the seven holding it (tried, 24 shipped seeds a way) the fight for it is heard, the building's men come out to it, and the team wins 21 of 24 with
// the lights ON and 22 of 24 with them out — the dark stopped mattering. The trial is rebuild/missions/new/floodlit-shed-held.patch in the project files.
// What is left burning with the mains out is on batteries and too dim for a bare eye: a red obstruction lamp on the radio mast on the front wall (the yard's
// tubes need something to amplify — headless the stand-in meter has no moon and no bounce) and a hurricane lantern in each room (so a man who walks in
// beside one can still be seen and fought at arm's length: the dark is an edge, not a switch that ends the fight; their strength, 6, is the mission's dial —
// at 4 the dark cost 11 teammates of 96 over 24 shipped seeds, at 6 it costs 34, at 8 38, and the yard taken lit costs 54 and a third of the runs). No emergency beacons. The MOON is an
// overcast night's 0.04: the page's meter counts it (probe.wgsl sums kind-2 lights) where the headless stand-in does not, and at the kit's 0.9 the yard
// with the mains out read about half lit to a bare eye there (floodlit-check asks nvg.ts nvgPlaceLight, which counts the moon, for that reason).
// CHECKED WITH THE FOUR ONLY: bun run tools/qa/scenario-level-probes.ts levels/floodlit.json --only data,four --seeds 3,4,5,6,7,8 — the level is not tuned
// for a pair (a pair crossing the lit yard is wiped on most of that probe's seeds; that is the level's point, not a fault to tune away). WHEN THIS WAS
// WRITTEN the probe's default seeds were 1,2,3 and seed 2 was red with the four: the last defender left by the store's back door and stood in the dark
// strip east of the building, and that probe's driver has no hunt (it ran to its time cap with one teammate up). playthrough.ts's commander hunts him:
// 48 of 48 shipped runs ended. ON THE BUILD OF 3752969b (10-14, frozen stand) the default is seeds 0,1,2,3 (0 = the level's own marks) and the four
// takes the floor on all four (seed 2 at 51.8 s, one teammate up); the pair is wiped on 0, 1 and 2 and takes it on 3, which the probe does not ask of it.
