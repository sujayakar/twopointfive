// TUT-SOLO — the tutorial's solo loud mission, "Alone, loud": THE FUEL HALT. One man, a rifle with a launcher, a pistol, a smoke, a stun can, two frags and
// one door charge, walked along ONE LINE: the road and its shot-up van, the yard gate, the truck court, the arch, the gun court, the shop's locked door, the
// store behind it, and back out the way he came with the halt's code book. One new action a step, each inside a fight that is a size bigger than the last:
// a sentry who cannot see him, a gun that can, a gun's nest for a frag, a door for a charge, a room for a stun can, and two men at his back for the launcher.
//
// THE SENTENCE NOBODY COULD SAY OF ANOTHER LEVEL: every piece of cover on it is the lesson for the key that uses it.
// THE HAND PLACEMENT: the fights are the level's script (levels/tut-solo.script.ts): the five men of the roster are held on their marks until their beat, so the
// first of every list here is the only deal there is. The sentry stands in the gate's line and nowhere near cover; the gun's cone through the arch falls on the
// parked truck and never on the way to the arch's near jamb; the sandbags, the gap and the barrier are one crouch, one smoke and one frag long.
