// THE GLASSHOUSE — one idea: GLASS IS NOT COVER (levels/glasshouse.json ← bun run tools/levels/export.ts glasshouse). A district seed station at night: one
// whitewashed block building whose whole front is glazed (the glasshouse, a long room of seedling benches behind six tall panes, 0.3 m off the ground to
// 2.4) and whose inside walls between the glasshouse, the lab and the office are glass from 0.5 m to 2.4. Seven men. The forecourt is floodlit off the eaves
// and the glazed rooms are dark, so whoever walks onto the forecourt is seen from three rooms at once by men he cannot see, and their rounds come through
// the panes (game/glasspen.ts; a pane is a toll, not a wall). The other three sides are blank block wall. The store, on the back, is the one room with no
// glass in any wall; it has its own door on the dark back lot, and a row of seed racks stands between that room and its door to the lab.
// TWO WAYS IN (scenarios.roomClear.team / starts[0]), BOTH IN THE DARK AND OUT OF EVERY DEFENDER MARK'S SIGHT: the side of the building, round the corner
// from the glass (stepping onto the lit forecourt in front of the panes is the player's own decision); or the back lot, on the back door.

/** THE ROOM CLEAR (scene/scenarios.ts StructureData). Seven men: glasshouse 3, lab 2, office 1, store 1.
 *  THE HAND PLACEMENT (roomclear.ts placeDefenders: seed 0 / attempt 1 = each room's first `garrison` marks IN FILE ORDER; the page deals it on every try).
 *  The problem, in one sentence: men in the dark watch a floodlit forecourt through glass that stops no round.
 *  (The answers: come in through a wall that is not glass — the back door, or a hole of your own in the blank end wall — or put the light out.)
 *  · THE FORECOURT (the obvious plan: the short walk along the lit panes to the front door) is under four guns in three rooms from the first pane on:
 *    glasshouse 1 at the end by the side yard and glasshouse 2 at the far end, each through its own bank (a crossfire down the forecourt's length); lab 1 and
 *    office 1 at their own glass, through two panes each. All four stand in the dark; the forecourt is floodlit. What says so before contact: the lamps.
 *  · THEIR BACK (answer A: the back door into the store, the one room with no glass) costs too: the store's man stands under the store's own bulb, a fair
 *    first kill from the dark back lot, but the squad then stands in that light — the breaker is on the wall by the back door: the lamps' conduit runs round the
 *    building to a meter box outside it, and the store's vent shows the bulb — and the store's door into the lab is under two guns on two lines: lab 2 from the
 *    far side of the lab, glasshouse 3 through the lab's pane (Front's rear man, looking into the lab). A spare office mark has a third line through its pane.
 *  · THE BLANK END WALL (answer B: the wall charge the mission issues, `wallCharges`, from the side yard where way 1 starts) opens the glasshouse at its end:
 *    glasshouse 1 stands three metres inside it (stunned by the charge, not floored), and the fight is down the room's length against glasshouse 2 and 3, with
 *    the Back squad free to come round.
 *  SQUADS: Front (the glasshouse) stays at its glass, whatever is hit: with one pool every contact in the store drew all seven through the store's door into
 *  the racks, and every plan that began at the back door was one and the same fight (12 seeds, hard: 46 of 48 teammates up from way 1). Back (lab, office,
 *  store) is free: what it does is the AI's call. */
