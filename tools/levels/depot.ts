// THE DEPOT — a motor pool at night: three huts round a floodlit yard, and a dark signals hut and a store's hatch that look across it.
// A level generator in the scenario levels' shape (tools/levels/test-rooms.ts is the template; rebuild/scenario-levels/contract.md the how-to):
//   bun run tools/levels/export.ts depot [--check]     → levels/depot.json (+ levels/depot-gwot.json), with its `scenarios.roomClear` block
//   page: ?levelFile=depot.json&roomclear&squad4       · headless: bun run tools/qa/probes.ts depot
//
// ONE PROBLEM, in a sentence: THE SIGNALS HUT AND THE STORE'S HATCH HOLD THE LIT YARD IN A CROSSFIRE FROM THE DARK, AND THE HUT'S OWN DOOR — AND THE
// MAINS — ARE AT ITS BACK.
// What is placed by hand, and why (seed 0 = each room's first `garrison` marks in the order they are written below; five men):
//   · the YARD is lit by floodlights on the mains (two on the hut's walls, one over the yard's mouth); the crew room's obvious door opens on it;
//   · the SIGNALS HUT (comms room, two men, dark) stands out into the yard. Its windows have no glass. One man at its WEST slit looks the length of the yard
//     onto the crew room's door; the other at its EAST slit looks over the aerial park, which a third floodlight lights. Its only door is on the far side,
//     through the generator room, and the mains panel is in there on the wall;
//   · the STORE (two men, dark) has an issue hatch in its yard wall: one man covers the crew room's door through it from the other side of the yard, the
//     other the battery room's door and the middle of the yard;
//   · the CREW ROOM (one man) is lit: he is the one a stack on the yard door would be fighting while guns it cannot see into shoot it in the back.
// The obvious plan — in by the main gate, across the yard, stack on the crew room — is stood in floodlight between the slit and the hatch.
// The answers the floor is cut for (none free), and they are different fights:
//   · ROUND THE BACK: from the east gate, the gap in the park's wall, the lane behind the signals shelter, a metre in the east slit's sight past the
//     shelter's nose, the generator room's door; then the mains, and the hut's own door at the watchers' backs. With the light out the yard is nobody's; left on, every way
//     from the north bar to the store is across it, under the hatch.
//   · THE STORES' WAY: along the south bar's wall, behind the truck, to the workshop's side door — a few lit metres and a stack in the west slit's
//     sight, out of the hatch's; then the bay, and the store's bay door behind the hatch (one man has his back to it, the other has it at the edge of
//     his eye). The price is that door, and the way on: the crew room's door is still under the west slit, and the hut is still to take, lights on.
// The two nests cover each other's blind sides: the west slit sees the south bar's wall as far as the hatch's jamb, the hatch sees the hut's south
// window. What neither sees is the store's wall east of the hatch.
// The second start (the east gate) is a different problem: the near door is the store's yard door, and it is an arm's length from the hatch.
// The tool it rewards: the mains. Everything is readable from either gate before anybody is in range: the floodlights and what they light, the dark
// slits and the hatch that look at the lit doors, the hut with no door on the yard, the truck and the workshop's door past it, the gap in the park's
// wall and the shelter behind it.
