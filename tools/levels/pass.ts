// THE PASS — a level MADE FOR SNOW (levels/pass.json ← bun run tools/levels/export.ts pass). A walled caravan stop on a high pass road, at night, in winter:
// a teahouse and truck halt. One range of three rooms along the back wall (the tea room, the kitchen, the store), the bunk room turned down the side from
// the store, an open garage bay and a generator lean-to across the yard, and one gate onto the road. A lorry stands snowed in where it stopped, half through its turn
// inside the gate. Eight men in four rooms.
// THE SNOW IS IN THE FILE, laid by hand below (group 'snow.*'): the ground is snow paint; drifts are banked on the windward side (the wind is off the
// north-west) of the walls, the lorry and whatever stands in the open, deeper in the corners; caps lie on the tops of the yard wall, the gate posts, the
// lorry, the wood, the crates; trodden paths run from the gate to the doors, the ground is cleared to earth at the gate, the tea room's door and the
// generator, and two ruts run in from the road to the lorry's back wheels. Nothing white lies under a roof: a little grey slush is tracked in at each
// outside door. What FALLS is the weather's (src/game/weatherKinds.ts, keyed on this level's name) and no part of this file.
// THE LIGHT is a cold moon on the snow and warm things that burn: the lamp over the gate, a brazier in front of the tea room, bulbs in the tea room, the kitchen and the
// store (the mains: the generator in the lean-to), a stove's glow in the tea room and the bunk room, the bread oven's in the kitchen, lanterns. The tea
// room's two windows, the kitchen's and the bunk room's throw their light out onto the snow.
// TWO WAYS IN (scenarios.roomClear.team / starts[0]), both in the dark and behind a wall from every mark: the road, west of the gate and outside its lamp;
// or the back of the range, outside the wall, on the kitchen's back door.

// colours, boxes only; no second look file.
// WHAT A SNOW PIECE IS TO A MAN (scene/collision.ts: a static blocks feet and the nav grid only where it stands over 0.2 m):
//   · ground, road, cleared earth  = thin solid slabs at the floor (feet, rounds and light land on them);
//   · paths, ruts, tracked-in slush = decals (NoShadow: drawn and lit, no ray and no collision query sees them);
//   · a DRIFT                       = solid boxes whose top is under 0.2 m (the check holds 0.19; the tallest is 0.18): men wade through it, a round knocks snow out of it;
//   · a BANK                        = a drift with tiers over 0.2 m: it stops feet. Only against a wall or the lorry, never within 1.4 m of a door;
//   · a CAP                         = a decal on the top of a thing: a round goes through it to the thing; where the thing is cover that breaks (the
//                                     wood, a wooden crate) the cap is to the wall engine what every decal on a broken piece is (game/wallbreak.ts `ghosts`).

/** THE ROOM CLEAR (scene/scenarios.ts StructureData). Eight men: the tea room 3, the kitchen 2, the store 1, the bunk room 2.
 *  THE HAND PLACEMENT (roomclear.ts placeDefenders: seed 0 / attempt 1 = each room's first `garrison` marks IN FILE ORDER; the page deals it on every try).
 *  The problem, in one sentence: the yard between the lorry and the doors is white, lit and watched through glass from two sides.
 *  · THE GATE is the one hole in the wall and it is lit, but THE LORRY stands 2.6 m inside it, between it and the tea room's two windows: a team comes in
 *    behind the lorry. Only bunk 1, at the dark bunk room's window, has the gateway, from the side (a low wall of sandbags stands on that side of it).
 *    (It was not so at first: with the lorry up the yard and two men of the tea room at the glass on the gateway, the plain scripted team was down inside
 *    8 to 14 s of the gate on one seed in three. A hole that kills before a decision is no problem to solve.)
 *  · THE YARD (the obvious plan: round the lorry and across to the tea room's door) is the tea room's: tea 1 at the window right of the door on the yard
 *    east of the lorry, tea 2 at the window left of it on the yard west of the lorry, and the bunk room's window behind a team that goes east. What says so
 *    before contact: lit windows on the snow, the brazier burning in front of them, the lantern at the door.
 *  · THE BACK (answer A: way 2, the kitchen's back door, outside the wall) opens on the kitchen's two men, one of them set on that door, with the tea room's
 *    third man on the door between the two rooms: a fight at one door instead of a walk under two windows.
 *  · THE DARK (answer B): the generator and the breaker are in the lean-to across the yard, reached from the gate along the lorry's west side and the bay,
 *    out of the east window and the bunk room's. With the mains out the gate lamp and the bulbs are gone and the tea room is a stove's glow and a lantern;
 *    the brazier still burns in front of it.
 *  SQUADS: House (the tea room and the kitchen) and Lines (the store and the bunk room). What either does when the other is hit is the AI's call. Each may
 *  wedge only its own yard door ('tea', 'bunk'): the kitchen's yard door and its back door are never theirs to shut (tools/qa/second-way-check.ts). */
