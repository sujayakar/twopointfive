// THE LEDGER — the tutorial's quiet mission: one line through a money changer's shop on a snowing night, alone, and each stretch of it is ONE tool and one
// small thrill. The level is made for this mission and for nothing else (no shared yard under it): a shop off a bazaar street, its forecourt behind a street
// wall, a lane along its side, a back court where a man keeps a fire in a drum, and the town standing close round it — shuttered fronts and stalls on the
// street, the neighbours' upper windows over the back wall. Snow lies on all of it (the level's own weather: src/game/weatherKinds.ts SNOW_LEVELS).

// THE LINE (scenarios.lesson; tools/qa/lessons/tut-quiet.ts plays it by input alone):
//   the lane        light: out of the porch lamp, round the shop's corner, along the trodden path to the mark.
//   the long wall   sound, then hands: a whistle at the mark and the player steps behind the long wall. The back court's man leaves his fire and comes the
//                   long way round, along the walk on the wall's other side, to where the sound was, and stands looking at it with his back to the wall's
//                   end. Round the end, a grab from the dark; he is asked, and gives the strongroom's code; then the choice: out cold, or the knife.
//   the back door   a lock picked in the long wall's shadow, the court's lamp and fire a wall away and nobody left to watch.
//   the store       the dark corner beside a lit doorway: the hall's man stands a stride inside it with his back turned, and the chest beam runs across
//                   the hall at his back, between him and the doorway: nobody stands up behind him without breaking it. So the rifle comes off his
//                   back, its launcher's grenade is swapped for a sponge round, and the man is put out from the store, through the doorway (see THE
//                   SPONGE ROUND below). The rifle goes away again: the rest is hands.
//   the hall        the same beam (under it on a knee), a beam at the shins across the counting room's doorway (nothing goes under that): the mains.
//   the set piece   night vision, the box: every lamp and the shin beam die. The clerk is the nearest man to the box and has the longest walk to it,
//                   round the counter's far end: ten seconds of him coming, in green, his light ahead of him. The player is in the niche by the doorway,
//                   behind its stub of wall; the man comes through, walks past it to the box and works there with his back to it (this level's box
//                   takes seven seconds, breaker.fumble). Taken there, the shop is the player's: the first man's code opens the strongroom, the safe, out by the front door.
//
// THE TWO HALVES. Everything up to the back door is hands and senses, out of doors (light, a sound, a grab, a question, a lock); everything past it is the
// shop's own tools, indoors (a beam, the mains, night vision, a code, a safe). The level is cut on that line too: the cross wall and the back door.
//
// WHY EACH TIMED BEAT IS BUILT AS IT IS: a line is read before it is obeyed. A beat with a clock (a man coming) has its whole instruction in the line that
// is up BEFORE the clock starts ('whistle here, then hide'; 'the box, then behind the wall'), and the man's walk is long enough for the next line to be read
// while he is on his way: the long wall in the lane, the long counter in the shop. Nothing asks for a reaction inside two seconds.
//
// THE SPONGE ROUND, AND THE SWAP OF THE LAUNCHER'S LOAD (the maintainer, of the solo mission's launcher card: "we can also not teach swapping secondaries
// at this point and only have 40mm. we can introduce sponge rounds + swapping secondaries later when we have a stealth tutorial"). This is that mission.
//   WHAT HE CARRIES (scenarios.issue): the rifle with one grenade and five sponge rounds on its launcher, and the launcher comes up on the GRENADE
//                   (`loaded`). The swap is then a thing he needs, with its reason in plain sight: the grenade is the loud one. No cans and no frag
//                   are on him: nothing on the kit strip that no line of this mission uses.
//   WHO             the hall's man. Of the three he is the one a second pair of hands was spent on (the first man is grabbed for the code, the clerk is
//                   taken at the box), and he is the one a wall hides the player from: the shot is let go from the store, at his back.
//   WHY NOT HANDS   the chest beam is 0.45 m behind his heels. A man on his feet behind him stands in it (devices.ts: the player's own body breaks a
//                   beam, at any capsule). The frame keeps the game from walking him into it: from `nook` to the beam the trigger and the held
//                   left click that stalks a man (`stalk`, rails.ts gate) are not his, nor the whistle, which would bring the man round to the
//                   store, nor the right button until the shot's own line. The interaction key stays his through the store. (The first build shut the held click by taking that key
//                   from the first line inside: a tap at the open back door then did nothing and said nothing.) The grab's own row is still his
//                   close behind the man, and the hand that takes him breaks the beam: the room says no, not a dead key.
//   WHERE FROM      the dark corner he is sent to has no line to the man: the doorway's own wall is in the way. A round let go from there does not
//                   reach him (on the real page one left the tube and he turned to the knock; in the harness on the page's stand none left it, on the
//                   frozen stand one did). So the corner is where the rifle comes out and the load is swapped, and a line of its own then puts a
//                   mark on the floor where the shot can be made: on the doorway's line, 2.6 m behind his back. That floor is in the doorway's light
//                   (the hall's bulb through it); the dark floor with a line to him is a strip under half a metre wide along the light's edge, too thin
//                   to send a player to. Nobody is looking that way: the man has his back to it and a wall stands between it and the table.
//   THE STEPS       inside, and at once the line that names the laser and sends him to the dark corner · rifle (2) · the card, then the swap (the frame's action `load`: the setup's load row alone, the right button still shut) · the
//                   step out to the mark · the shot (the right button held, the arc, let go) · the rifle put away (the hands' own key: the next
//                   man is taken by hand).
//   NEVER STUCK     five sponge rounds, and a launcher with none left passes the shot's line (lesson.ts `ringsOut`): the lesson goes on with him
//                   on his feet, and what that costs is the mission's to say, not a line that can no longer be done.
//
// THREE MEN, each with one beat. A fourth (inside the front door) was taken out: seven metres from the box through an open doorway he heard the clerk go
// down and turned his light on the player, and nothing in the room could hide that.
//
// SNOW AND LIGHT. The moon is thin and stands low behind the shop from where the camera looks (the number is the pass's, the snow level tuned on a GPU: snow
// is the brightest ground there is). What lights the night is what burns: the porch lamp and the court's lamp (the mains), the fire in the court's drum and
// two lanterns left on stall counters (their own fuel: they stay when the mains go). Every wall between a flame and the player's line is higher than the
// flame: the fire and the lanterns light the falling snow and the walls' far sides, never the lane, the walk or the back door (worked out in the file, where
// each is placed). UNDERFOOT: fresh snow is the soft quiet floor ('grass'); the street, the alley, the trodden paths and the swept court are hard ('asphalt');
// the rooms are 'stone', as they were. The mission's whole walking line lies on path, court and floor.
//
// WHAT IS KEPT FROM THE FIRST BUILD, to the centimetre: the shop's walls and doors, the low walls, both lamps, the beams, the box, the pad, the safe and
// every mark the lesson and its scripted player name (TQ). What is new is the place they stand in.
