/// THE BACK KEY: Esc is the pause, and only the pause; what Esc used to back out of in the fight — the squad's order menu (a page of it: back to the first), the
/// open Space list, a running sustained verb (the leaf being eased, the pick, the choke, the drive), the launcher's held arc — backs out on Tab. The maintainer,
/// 10-17: "esc is overloaded -- exiting out of menus as well as going to pause. maybe we make tab exit out of menus and esc is always pause?"
///   `BACKKEY.tab` — ON in the page (`?tabback=0` = Esc backs out first and pauses only with nothing to back out of, as it did), OFF here and on the frozen
///   stand (`TPS_TABBACK=1`). A recording from before the key replays with it off: a Tab in its ticks did nothing.
/// WHO READS WHAT. In the tick the back key is a press like any other: orders.ts takes it out of the frame with the menu up, interact.ts and player.ts read it
/// after. An Escape that reaches the tick still backs out with the rule on (the harness's presses, an older tape's): on the PAGE none reaches it — the page's
/// handler (main.ts) takes the press out of the frame's keys before it toggles the pause, so no tick and no recording holds it.
/// 'Paused': a key let go under the pause card would act on the tick play comes back (the Space list does its row, the launcher sends its round). With the rule
/// on the loop hands the first tick after a frozen frame the one-tick code 'Paused', as Input hands it 'Blur': interact.ts shuts a held list
/// with its press spent, player.ts lets go of a held arc unsent. It is a press in the tick's keys, so a recording carries it and a replay does the same; nothing
/// of the game is changed between ticks for it. The order menu and a running verb are still there after the pause.
/// The objectives card (ui/tabcard.ts) has the key whenever there is nothing to back out of (Game.backable). Imports nothing.
