# Renderer

One of the area files CLAUDE.md indexes. Everything below was moved here word for word from CLAUDE.md on 2026-10-13, in its old order;
"the bullet above / below" in a bullet means its neighbour there (each block says which lines it was), and a bullet named by its bold
title may now live in another file of this folder: `grep -l '<title>' docs/agents/*.md`. New bullets for this area go at the foot of this file.

## Judging renderer output

Whole-frame captures downscaled into a chat hide exactly the defects that matter (penumbra stipple, ragged
iso-contours at a spot edge, probe-sized blotches, sparkle near small emitters, discs around dim lights). Crop
200–400 px tiles around shadow edges / light-pool boundaries / emitters, upscale 3–4×, compare before/after tiles,
and look at the debug views (`engine.settings.debugView`: direct-only, indirect-only) as well as the composite.
`sips -c H W --cropOffset Y X` + `sips -Z` does it on macOS. For "lossless" claims use the pixel A/B harness:
`?paused` boot, identical stepping, `__png` both variants, diff (max/mean/>2/>8 counts) against a same-variant
noise floor captured the same way; when A/B-ing smoke shading freeze the field with `smoke.params.frozen = true` (holds
the field AND still renders it — `enabled=false` renders no smoke at all, so any smoke A/B passes vacuously).
Determinism checklist for captures (learned the hard way): zero every character's `anim.phase` (it is seeded with
`Math.random()`; the idle / breathing / weight-shift clocks are desynced from the character id — deterministic, leave them), park the guards AND their torches somewhere they light nothing (or disable the torches), seed
`Math.random` if emitters are involved, never let the rAF loop run between boot and capture (`?paused` + a
screenshot to give the pane a size, then only `__runFrames`), and for views with MEN ON SCREEN call `game.restartEncounter()` right
after seeding `Math.random` and before staging (the guards' construction-time dice — glance clocks, waits — were drawn unseeded at boot,
and a staged man's head otherwise sits differently boot to boot). With that, two boots are bit-identical in every view;
`tools/qa/rig-identity.js` (`__idrun`) is the recipe end to end (corridor / lobby / cubicles stills with 2–4 men, hashable across boots at every preset).
**ONE CONFIG PER FRESH BOOT** for every identity pass and every look A/B (learned again on the smoke lab): two stagings inside one page never compare — the cubicles'
flickering fixtures, the haze clock, the TAAU phase, the storm and the wind all key on the game / render clocks and the frame index, which the first run has advanced by
the time the second starts — so navigate afresh (`?paused`), run the SAME call sequence from boot for each build / setting (cross-build claims: main served BESIDE the lane on
its own port, both driven identically) and compare the hashes / PNGs left on the sink by name (`__rf.identity / pngs`, `__idrun` are that shape).
Numbers and hashes recorded before 08-12 reproduce only with that day's new defaults off (`?nogatherstrata&nomotioncalm`, and `?noiq` for anything from before the image-quality
program); harnesses that hash against main served beside stay valid, since both sides boot the same defaults.

## GPU timing — known traps

`engine.timer` timestamps are per pass. **Render-pass** timestamps (gbuffer/composite/post/fxaa) on Metal span the
wait for the drawable and read ≈ one frame — ignore them (the HUD lists compute passes only). Scripted
`__runFrames` stepping returns stale timer values UNLESS each frame is followed by `await device.queue.onSubmittedWorkDone()`
+ a MessageChannel yield: that serializes frames (no cross-frame overlap inflating passes) and lets the readbacks resolve
even with the pane hidden — two 30-frame baselines then agree to ~0.02 ms and match the live HUD (this is how the trade-off
options were timed). Without it, hidden-pane numbers are garbage. Interleave A/B/A/B either way. Reference numbers (M4 Max, high, calm office, renderer v3): ≈ 10–11 ms union at 1368×770 with the
08-12 defaults (sharp direct + GBAA, motion-calm, gatherStrata, near mesh shadows at high — docs/internal/trace-perf.md §0 / render-defects-0812.md carry those takes; ≈ 8–10 ms before them) — see docs/perf/v3-gate-phase4.json and
docs/internal/p2a-restir.md for per-pass tables (the pre-v3 frame was ~20 ms: direct ≈7, softblur ≈3, gather ≈6, cascades ≈2, volumetrics ≈1). **The GPU is SHARED with every other lane's page** (and the
maintainer's own tab): a take that overlaps someone else's measurement is worthless — `sh tools/qa/gpu-quiet.sh` waits for `ioreg` Device Utilization to sit under 8 % before a take, rounds are
interleaved and filtered to their quiet minimum, and a row whose p75 sits far above its median is quoted as contended, never as a result.

- **Markings = object legibility** — palette-indexed bitmaps on box faces, packed in the tail of `boxMat` (no texture); `settings.markings` default ON, `?nomarkings` (+ `?level=relief` = main's frame), `__mark`; emissive markings are LIGHTS; the art rules (flat colour per cell, ≤ 3 entries, no gradients, no baked lighting) — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Materials, RT reflections, the detail layer** (renderer v3 phase 4) — every box carries a finish (`Box.rough / metal / aniso`), `reflect.wgsl` traces under `settings.rtReflect` (`?nortreflect`, `frame.rtCfg.w` 0 = off), the detail layer under `settings.detail` (`?detail=0‥1`; art rule: variation from geometry, never a painted texture); `__rt`, `__hotReflect` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **The ultra-only extras** (renderer v3 phase 5) — `settings.giResample` / `rtMeshHits` / `rtHitReuse`, only the ultra preset raises them, `?nop5` vetoes; `__gi`, `__hotGather`; TRAP kept here: `reflect_p5.wgsl` is a separate program from `reflect.wgsl` on purpose (main's text) — keep the two files in step — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Character proxies = the SDF character rig** — every mannequin's 15 shadow / reflection proxies are round cones fitted at load (`render/sdfrig.ts`, `shaders/sdfrig.wgsl`), no switch; extras in `frame.rigCfg` (`settings.charSelfShadow` default ON, `?noselfshadow`; `?sdfsmooth` / `?charsoft` / `?charsoftmarch` experiments); `__sdfrig`, `__rigTrace` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.

- **Effects numbers** are tuned by the user in the viewer and pasted back; treat `effects.ts` / `RIG` values as
  authored data — change them only from viewer readouts or explicit notes. (`effects.ts tracerFx` — tracer speed / shutter /
  thickness / emissive / head-light intensity + range / ember / pool caps — ships UNTUNED: viewer Guard ▸ carbine: tracers (K),
  or Tab ▸ Effects ▸ tracer rows in the corridor at night, then paste back.)
- **No dollhouse wall cutaway** in the game — it was removed by user decision (they rotate the camera instead — Ctrl + mouse orbits and Ctrl + wheel zooms now, host/loop.ts; Q / E are the wall hold and the holster);
  don't bring it back. The `Cutaway` box flag + `cutHeight` primitive survives only for the viewer stage's back wall.
  Debug/sandbox actions are debugger (tweak panel) buttons, not hotkeys.
- **Quality**: `ui/quality.ts` presets (ultra / high / medium / low / verylow) set resolution scale + internal-height cap, beam steps,
  cache grid, smoke iterations, the direct-light ray budget (8/4/3 · 8/4/3 · 6/3/3 · 4/2/2 · 1/1/2), `directHistory` (0.5; high and verylow 0.7)
  AND the lossy trade-offs below (ultra none · high checker + third-res gather + dimRays · medium/low/verylow those + quarter-res beams, with
  staggered cascade refresh `rcPeriods` in place of `rcHalfRate`; low/verylow with `dimRaysBelow` 0.02) AND the final gather's relative firefly bound `settings.giFireflyK` (4 on high‥verylow; 0 = off on ultra:
  the bound is a one-sided clamp — it cut the boil round a torch on a wall by ~40 % but costs up to a quarter of the bounce within ~0.6 m
  of an intense hotspot — so the reference preset runs without it; Tab ▸ Indirect light slider for A/B) — applying a preset writes those
  settings exactly as the menu rows do; a row flipped by hand sticks until the next preset change. `auto` first CALIBRATES behind the start card (a couple of seconds of GPU compute-pass timings → a per-pass
  cost model, `COST`/`REF`/`FACTOR` in quality.ts: per-pixel and fixed factors per preset → preset AND scale in one step, remembered
  per machine; ladder verylow‥high, never ultra; 'auto' picked later on the pause card / Tab runs the SAME path — `Quality.startAuto`:
  from this machine's remembered pick + scale, re-measured behind that card, the card's note refreshed when it settles), then a runtime ladder trims (proportional scale steps toward LADDER.aimFps 50, cut below 45 / restore above 58, ≥ 2 s apart on a 0.05 grid, preset drop
  once a real cut is off, floor SCALE_FLOOR 0.5). THOSE ARE THE 'AS NOW' BANDS: since 10-10 the ladder's default is HOLD 60 (`settings.ladderAim` 60, the maintainer's pick; `?aim=asnow` or `?aim=0` = the bands above for the visit, `?aim=90|120|display` other targets, Tab ▸ Frame ▸ 'ladder: frame rate to hold'; `ui/quality.ts HOLD / ladderBands`): the same climb, but two 1-s windows under ~58 fps with the GPU the limit cut the scale straight to what the cost model says holds 60 (to the floor, then the preset under auto), and pixels come back on measured GPU room; a page something else paces is left alone (as now: `settings.ladderPaced`, `?ladderpaced=0`; under an aim, since 10-14: `settings.ladderHeld`, default on, `?ladderheld=0` or Tab ▸ Frame ▸ 'ladder: an aim leaves a held page alone' = an aim as it was. The maintainer's Mac on a low battery, 10-14: the browser held the page at 30 fps, the GPU clocked down and read ~1.5× longer, and hold 60 stepped High from 770 to 600 rows for a rate that stayed 30. What cut it (read off the code and the replay, not the budget rule first blamed): the union at High's start read 13.9 ms on the slow clock, over the 13.33 ms back-off band, so the `hot` rule took a step every two windows, and the strict restore (the next step priced under 12.0 ms) never gave one back. On, the as-now paced check runs under an aim too: (a) a slow window is PROVEN paced when the union fits the aim's frame less HOLD.pacedMs (10.67 ms at 60) and the frame is more than those 6 ms over it; (b) slow, not GPU-bound, not proven, no pace known: over the back-off band the band's own step goes first as ever (and is judged like any cut); inside it, a judged cut to the highest scale the cost model prices under that floor (none where the scale floor cannot reach it: a small window, a union far over; a step further if it lands short). Proven there, the frame decides: no shorter = the pixels straight back to where the chain began, the failed-rung marks it left restored, that rate remembered as the page's pace; shorter by PACED.probeGain (15 %: a missed vsync bought back is a whole refresh, less is the rate's own wobble) = the cut stays and the level it left is a failed rung; no step up while a cut waits for its verdict; (c) a cut that proves nothing by the end of its 12 s trial goes back to where it started with no pace learnt, the next held off 60 s, doubling; after a judged take-back the next cut comes no sooner than the re-test would; (d) at the pace: no cut for the union's size, no `hot` step, no preset starved, and a scale under the tier's start comes back a grid step at a time on the frame's own room, each step judged (the frame grew = the step off and the pace forgotten); (e) the pace is dropped for a re-test after PACED.recheckSecs (120 s, doubling), which is those same judged cuts again (about 10 s under the tier's start). Check: `ladder-replay.ts --selftest`, the 'page something else holds' block (sixteen cases: held five minutes, the hold lifting, arriving cut, a fight on a held page, a fixed 60 Hz display missing vsync under and over the band, real load, the re-test, the marks, four never-held machines with other overheads, auto, a cut that tells nothing, a machine the cost model is wrong about, the failed rung after a cut that helped, a CPU-bound frame that wobbles, nothing holding); `LADDERHELD_BREAK=1` in front must FAIL eight of its lines (exit 1). Measured 10-14, headless only, after two reviews (the second found a never-held fixed 60 Hz machine left 25 % short of pixels, a cut / step up / cut loop where the model is wrong, a sawtooth after a cut that helped, and cuts repeating on a wobbling rate: all four mended and now cases above): off = the tree before it move for move (600 fuzz machines, as now either way and an aim with it off, four sets: no outside holds / real ones × overhead inside 6 ms / up to 9); on, machines nothing ever held spend the same seconds under 58 fps with overhead inside 6 ms (within 0.1 s of 400) and fewer past it (a fixed display: 116 → 105 of 400, the judged cut finds a missed vsync the old rule let be); with holds coming and going, about 0.5 s more per machine under 58 fps outside the held spells, fixed 60 Hz +4.6 s of 197 (the limit below). 84 steadily held machines whose GPU time follows the pixels more or less than the model says: 26 keep more pixels, 50 the same, 8 lose under 0.015 of mean scale (the trial dips). His take 5 replayed (`--aim 60 --sweeps`, a sweep take, so read the rows only): mean 573 rows off, 730 on. His two F9 takes: identical moves off and on. The real page on the software adapter at his window size, fed held windows through its own ladder (`Quality.simulate`): ×0.75 at 3 s, ×0.70 at 6 s, ×0.55 at 9 s, ×0.77 again at 12 s and for the rest of two minutes; `?ladderheld=0` ends ×0.70. KNOWN LIMITS: a fight that starts on a held page before its pace is known, or a re-test inside one, is cut as before until it is over (the floor cannot bring 23 ms under 10.7); where the model says the scale floor cannot reach the proof's floor, nothing changes; a hold lifting mid-fight on a fixed 60 Hz display, with no fast second between, waits for the re-test; a hold that lifts and comes back inside the hold-off sits at ×0.70 as before until the next judged cut; a frame rate that wobbles 15 % a second by itself can read as a cut that helped (one step under the tier's start then stays held off); everything rests on HOLD.pacedMs = 6 as the frame's overhead past the union. The replay tool's own held-frame test (`heldOut`) stays apart from `holdProof` on purpose: it re-prices a RECORDED frame and knows the take's display rate, which the ladder does not. Never seen on a GPU or a held browser). `bun run tools/qa/ladder-replay.ts --selftest | <F9 take> --check | --aim 60` = the ladder replayed headless over a recording; quality-plan.ts's ladder checks pin as-now. Since 08-12 the ladder also CLIMBS on measured headroom (`settings.ladderClimb`, default on; `capClimb` off): union-driven,
  0.05 a rung up to ×0.95 (1.0 would drop sharp direct), then gather ⅓ → ½ and beams ¼ → ½, backing off newest-first with doubling holds; 'cruising' is judged from
  the GPU union priced at the next preset by the cost model (`Quality.hopRatio`), no longer from an fps threshold a 60 Hz display could never reach; `?quality=` holds
  the climb off. `?nomotioncalm` puts off what is now (08-12, the maintainer's call) the DEFAULT: Tab ▸ Frame / `__gimo.calm()` = the gi-motion lane's bundle (restirSpatialAll + restirPenRays + taauMotionAlpha 0.25 +
  taauSharpenMotion 0.15) that calms the DIRECT chain under camera motion at the price of contact-shadow softness — the maintainer's call (docs/internal/gi-motion.md). Since 08-11 `renderScale` is RELATIVE TO THE CAP: internal h = min(maxInternalHeight, cssH·dpr) × renderScale, so 1.0 =
  the preset's rows on any window tall enough and every step below it is real (`capScale`, `effectiveScale` = the true internal/css·dpr ratio for the cost model); render
  targets are pooled and temporal histories RESAMPLED across size changes (render/texpool.ts, `settings.keepHistories`), cascade instances parked per grid (`engine.rebuildRc` /
  `prewarmRc`). GPU cost: read the timer's UNION (`engine.timer.unionMs()`, HUD 'gpu ∪', recorder `gpuUnion`) — per-pass sums over-state a saturated frame by 35–55 %
  because independent compute passes overlap (docs/internal/p0a-cascades.md). `plan(gpuMs, fixedMs, preset, eff, cssH, dpr)` is the pure decision (exported; also
  `__quality.plan`); `bun run tools/qa/quality-plan.ts` prints the cost table and plan()'s picks for synthetic machines (M4 Max →
  high ×1.0, M1-class HiDPI → verylow, …) — re-run it after correcting REF/FACTOR from measured pass timings. Under automation set
  `window.__testVisible = true` or calibration/sampling wait forever on the hidden pane.
- **One cache grid at every preset** (10-23; `settings.oneCacheGrid`, on in the page and the workbench, `?onegrid=0` puts it off; no Tab row). WHY: the light meter the
  guards and teammates see by (`probe.wgsl`) is the shadowed direct light plus the cache's dice read trilinearly at the asked point, so the probe lattice is part of the
  reading. low and verylow ran a coarser lattice (32 × 3 × 22 against 40 × 4 × 28) and read tight night shadow two to three times darker: sneaking was easier on the low
  presets, and the auto ladder moved the rule under a mission whenever it stepped between medium and low. WHAT: every preset's `rc` row is the one grid; low and verylow
  keep the old one as `rcCoarse`, and `rcGridOf(preset, one)` is the only reader (the preset put on, the grids parked at boot, the cost model: `presetCost(p, oneGrid)`,
  `costTable`, `plan(…, oneGrid)`), so off = the grids AND the ladder's prices as they were. With it on no preset step rebuilds or swaps the cache, and nothing is parked
  at boot. No `FROZEN_HOLDS` row and no journal line: nothing in a step reads it (the meter reaches the game through `Game.sensors`, and the headless stand-in has no cache).
  MEASURED on the software adapter (the pair mission at night, the meter asked at 11 fixed points at 0.8 m and 1.5 m, ten drawn frames, one run each; E, then the HUD's
  LIGHT): in the gap between the containers verylow 0.015 / 0.018 (LIGHT 0) on the coarse grid, 0.046 / 0.057 (13) on the one grid, high 0.049 / 0.063 (15); behind the
  low wall at 0.8 m 0.045 → 0.103 against high's 0.113; the road in shadow LIGHT 0 → 9 (high 9); the partner's start 0 → 6 (high 7); points in the moon 46 to 48 on all
  three. What is left between verylow and high is under 10 % at nine of the eleven points and 14 % at a tenth (0.017 against 0.020), verylow mostly the lower: its far
  field refreshes over more frames and ten had not settled it (inferred). The eleventh sits beside a standing man at 0.8 m: 0.117 on both verylow grids, 0.052 on high. Not the cache: `occluded()` tests a character's skinned mesh where the preset has mesh shadows (ultra, high near) and his
  capsules elsewhere, so the meter's direct light in a man's own shadow is still the preset's (read in the code, one point; the meter's owner's, not mended).
  NOT MENDED: the read itself. One lattice makes the presets agree; it does not make the meter right — it still blends the cells around the asked point, some of them
  inside the wall or the container beside it (the bullet on BOUNCE WALLS says the same of a lit room's wall). A read of the meter's own (its own short fan of rays from the
  asked point, the cache only at their hits) would take the lattice out of the reading at every preset and cost a few thousand rays a frame, but it moves every LIGHT
  number the levels were tuned on. PRICE: low and verylow trace 2.1 × the probes at their own refresh periods; in the cost model their fixed part goes 1.9 → 2.4 and
  1.4 → 1.9 model-ms (`quality-plan.ts`: an M1 / M2-base-class machine, 4.5 × the reference, boots at verylow ×0.50 where it had low ×0.50; a 5.5 × one no longer fits
  the budget at the floor), about +0.2 ms a frame on the reference machine by the cache's measured 1.05 ms at high and the level shares. NEVER TIMED ON A GPU, and never
  seen on one: what low and verylow look like on the finer cache is not known. CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ladder` (family `perf`; the ladder's self-test, which
  now runs the page's grid, with five lines of this rule; `ONEGRID_BREAK=1` fails four; both stands). `rfix-proofs.ts r101` (the parked-grid hop) boots with `&onegrid=0`
  so it still crosses grids; that edit was not run. Page tools that pin `?quality=verylow` on the software adapter now trace the finer cache too.
- **One smoke pressure solve at every preset** (10-23; `settings.oneSmokeSolve`, on in the page and the workbench, `?onesolve=0` = each preset's own `rbIters` as it was:
  ultra 5, high 4, medium, low and verylow 3; no Tab row beside the solver's own 'pressure: rb pairs' slider; render-side, so no game table, no journal line, no
  `FROZEN_HOLDS` row: the headless stands solve no smoke on a GPU). WHY: a sight line through smoke (`game/sensors.ts` → `probe.wgsl` kind 1) is the optical depth of the
  SOLVER's density, and the pressure pairs decide how a plume rolls and spreads. With the pairs a preset row, the cloud that hides a man had another shape at medium than at
  high, and the auto ladder changed it under a fight each time it stepped: a game rule reading the graphics setting, as the meter's cache grid was. Every preset now runs high's
  4 (`rbItersOf(preset, one)` in ui/quality.ts, asked where a preset is applied). PRICE, by reading only: one pair more (two dispatches over the live bricks) a solver step
  on medium, low and verylow, one fewer on ultra; the cost model does not price the solver, so the ladder's price for a step down no longer includes a cheaper solve. The one figure on record is the old
  box solver's on the maintainer's own machine: 0.044 ms a pair a domain (`docs/internal/smoke-perf.md` §1b). NOT MEASURED: how far a plume's shape moved between 3, 4 and 5 pairs, so how much
  sight ever differed; and the cost. NOT MADE ONE by this: the density a sight line reads is still the page's solver, and the headless stand-in is another model
  (`docs/agents/replays.md`). CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ladder`, three lines (`ONESOLVE_BREAK=1` fails one), both stands. PAGE (the software adapter, the final code, `?paused&quality=medium&mute`):
  booted with 4 pairs at medium; low, verylow and medium applied in turn each left 4; with the setting put off and the same three applied, 3 each; back on, 4; a canister solved
  six frames at `stats.rbPairs` 4 with no GPU or page error. The `?onesolve=0` word itself was not opened on a page (one line beside `?onegrid=0`, read before the first
  preset). Never timed or seen on a GPU.
- **The smoke keeps high's look down the ladder** (10-23; `settings.smokeKeep` 0 | 1 | 2, 1 in the page and the workbench, `?smokekeep=0|1|2`, Tab ▸ Frame 'smoke under
  high'). The maintainer, with auto on medium: "a ton of the smoke became very blocky … the smoke looks so sick in our game that i'd rather we keep it closer to high but
  then tradeoff other things in the frame budget". WHAT WAS BLOCKY: under high the march ran at quarter size (`lossy.volQuarter`: one march texel under 4 × 4 internal
  pixels; high's half-size march has 2 × 2), lit by fewer lights a step (medium 3 / 2, low and verylow 2 / 0 = `caps.volK` / `caps.marchLights`, high 4 / 3) and on low and
  verylow with a 2.0 step that combs a plume's shadow edges. WHAT 1 DOES: on medium and low the smoke's rows are the better of the rung's own and high's (`withSmoke(preset, keep)`
  in quality.ts: the march at half size, high's lights a step, shadow refresh and step length), on the preset's OWN path — the froxel haze stays, beams are not the smoke —
  and everything else the rung sheds is still shed (rays, reflections, mesh shadows, bounce cards, denoiser passes, the cache's refresh, the pixel count). The ladder pays
  the difference where it always does first: in render scale. 2 = high's whole volumetric path as well (`caps.vol` 'classic': the per-pixel march for haze AND smoke,
  high's 20 beam steps): the smoke exactly as high draws it at the rung's pixel count, there so the two can be compared by eye. 0 = every preset's own rows, as it was.
  verylow keeps its own smoke at every value (`smokeOwn` on its row): it is the floor, with no rung beneath it to pay, so the smoke is the LAST thing the ladder sheds.
  The solver's iterations (`rbIters`) are not a look row and this switch does not move them: ONE SMOKE SOLVE, the bullet above. high and ultra are the same rows at 0, 1 and 2. With 1 or 2 on, the climb's
  'volumetrics ¼ → ½' rung has nothing to do above verylow, and the caps bullet's medium and low rows below are what 0 runs. `withSmoke` is the only
  reader (the rows put on, the live preset, `costTable(oneGrid, smokeKeep)`, `plan`), so 0 is the ladder as it was, prices included; `Quality.resmoke()` is the Tab row's
  by-hand step. No `FROZEN_HOLDS` row and no journal line: nothing in a step reads it (smoke SIGHT lines are the solver's density, not the march).
  WHAT IT COSTS — on the maintainer's Mac at high in a fight with one dust cloud live (the F8 sweep of 10-10, three rounds; that take's pass was beams and smoke on the
  classic path): the march at quarter size gave back 0.5 to 0.9 ms (0.4 in a calm view with no cloud), 2 lights a step where there were 4 gave 1.5 to 1.65, the froxel path
  1.5 to 1.85 — against 2.3 ms for render scale ×0.77 → ×0.60 and about 7.6 ms for all of medium. So at 1 a rung under high is dearer by roughly a millisecond at high's
  pixel count in a smoky fight (less at its own, about one 0.05 step of render scale on that Mac — INFERRED from those rows, not timed), and at 2 by about 1.5 more. The
  cost model only knows the calm still (medium's per-pixel part 13.3 → 13.5 → 14.0 model-ms at 0 · 1 · 2; no synthetic machine of `quality-plan.ts` changes its pick).
  OTHER THINGS A RUNG COULD GIVE UP INSTEAD, with that Mac's rows at high: the cache at half rate 0.9 ms, mesh shadows 0.8 (medium has none already), audit rays 0.5,
  direct light at 3 rays 0.26, held-light rays at 2 0.25 to 0.38; the reflections' passes read 3.2 ms but the frame moved 0.14. None is taken: by eye, the maintainer's.
  At 2 the model prices medium a shade UNDER 1 (it drops the froxel term and knows no fight): a setting for the eye, not for auto's arithmetic.
  NEVER TIMED OR SEEN ON A GPU. CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ladder` (family `perf`; nine lines of this rule in the ladder's self-test; `SMOKEKEEP_BREAK=1` fails
  two; both stands).
- **Worst-case caps (renderer v3 Phase 0)** — the loud minute (QRF weapon lights + rain + a floor full of smoke + a firefight's particles) bounded with no look change
  at rest; every tier runs the same capped paths, scaled by `PRESETS[*].caps` in quality.ts (ultra 6/2/1.5 · 512, high 4/2/1.5 · 384 — both on the CLASSIC per-pixel path since 08-12, `Caps.vol` —, medium 3/2/1.5 · 256,
  low 2/2/2.0 · 192, verylow 2/2/2.0 · 128 = volK/volEvery/volStep · births): (1) `settings.volLightCap` K (`frame.volCfg.x`; **0 = the volumetric
  pass bit for bit as it was**, proven on the vol texture) — volumetrics.wgsl marches each of the smoke's BOUNDS' own stretch of the ray front to back at that lattice's step (its comments still say 'domain')
  (merged where they overlap) instead of the hull of all of them at the finest voxel, builds a per-stretch shortlist (exact culls: range, the 0.03 floor, cone, panel
  facing; ≤ 16 sorted by unshadowed bound — never 'every light'), gives a shadow ray + self-shadow to the first K lights that reach each step (refreshed every
  `volShadowEvery` steps = `volCfg.y`, reused between; march step `volStepVoxels` = `volCfg.z` tenths — 2.0+ combs shadow edges in a plume, low/verylow only), caches the
  ambient's wall test per dice cell; haze beams keep the K strongest per ray by unshadowed in-scatter (64-bit mask; kind-2 always). Tab ▸ Direct light ▸ CAP rows.
  (2) `settings.particleBirths` → `Particles.prepare(dt, on, cap)`: births a frame; records that do not fit WAIT in the queue (long-lived kinds first once anything
  waits, arrival order untouched otherwise; an oversize record is born alone; a spark record shed after `SPARK_MAX_WAIT` 6 frames; queue ≤ `MAX_QUEUE` 512) —
  `probes.ts particles-queue` holds the defer contract. (3) the smoke solver's cap is no longer a preset's: which bricks step is the pool's own rule on every tier (calm and far bricks wait: the smoke bullet); `Caps.smokeFull` /
  `fullRateDomains` went with the boxes. Measure with `tools/qa/stress-scene.js` (`await import('/qa/stress-scene.js')`
  → `__stress.setup()` / `.record(n)` / `.ab(applyA, applyB)` / `.caps(on)` / `.table(r)`, serialized frames, orbiting camera) and `__hotVol(src?)` (recompile
  volumetrics.wgsl from disk — the dev server serves src/render/shaders under /qa/shader/ — and swap the pipeline in without rebooting a staged scene).
- **Froxel volumetrics** (renderer v3 Phase 2b) — `settings.froxelVol` per tier (`quality.ts Caps.vol`: ultra / high 'classic', medium and below 'froxel'), `?nofroxel` / `?froxel` force either; `settings.smokeMarchLights`; `__froxel`, `__hotFroxel` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Lossy options** (engine settings, default OFF in `defaultSettings`, switched ON by the presets as above; pause menu *Graphics —
  trade-offs* + `LOSSY:` rows in the Tab panel for A/B): `settings.checkerDirect` (frame flag 65536: shadow rays on a checkerboard
  half per frame, direct.wgsl), `gatherThird` / `volQuarter` (gather at 1/3, volumetrics at 1/4 res: `passes.setDivisors`, divisors
  in `frame.lossyCfg.xy`), `rcHalfRate` (`rc.halfRate`: uppers even frames, c0 + bake odd), `dimRays` + `dimRaysBelow`
  (`frame.lossyCfg.z`: one emitter sample per leader under that unshadowed luminance). `engine.render` mirrors the booleans every
  frame, so they are the single source of truth. Off must stay the untouched path — A/B them one at a time (pin `?quality=ultra` AND set `settings.volLightCap = 0`
  — every preset, ultra included, carries the Phase 0 volumetric cap; `__stress.caps(false)` puts both caps back to the untouched paths).
- **ReSTIR DI = the direct-light estimator** (renderer v3 phase 2a) — `settings.restir` default ON, `?norestir` = direct.wgsl's leader / tail path; the hybrid held-light path `settings.heldRays`; the motion twin `settings.restirMotion`, `?norestirmotion`; `__hotRestir` / `__hotDirect`, debug views 11 / 12 — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **TAAU** (renderer v3 phase 1) — `settings.taau` default ON, `?notaau` = the old chain; `__taa`; RULE kept here: `frame.viewProj / invViewProj / prevViewProj` ARE the jittered matrices — never build a screen ray from `cam.*` on the GPU side — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Sharp direct** (decoupled resolution) — `settings.sharpDirect`, switched on per tier by `quality.ts Preset.iq`, `?sharp` / `?nosharp` force it; live only under TAAU below scale 1.0; `__sharp` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **The resolve configuration per tier** (image-quality program) — `quality.ts IqTier` on `Preset.iq` (sharp direct + decoupled jitter + GBAA + history de-blur), `?noiq` = the resolve as it was, `?gbaa`, `?nomv` (`settings.motionIds`); harness `__iq` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Stratified gather directions + the trace lab** (ported from exp/trace-perf; the notebook is docs/internal/trace-perf.md, the page docs/review/trace-perf.html): `settings.gatherStrata`
  (default ON since 08-12 — the maintainer liked it; `?nogatherstrata` = the iid gather, `__gs {on, summary()}`, Tab ▸ Indirect light ▸ 'EXP: stratified gather directions') draws the final gather's k-th ray of four from
  STRATUM (k + frame) mod 4 of the cosine hemisphere (fgather.wgsl `cosineDirK`: azimuth half × cos²θ half; mainGi's two fresh rays a Latin square over the same cells; the young-history
  extras a complete stratified set of their own) instead of iid — UNBIASED (tile means within ±0.5 %, temporal sd equal or lower) but a whole 8×8 tile's k-th rays share a quarter of direction
  space and walk the grid coherently: gather 2.03 → 1.70 ms at high 1368×770 (−16 %), −0.8 ms at ultra. passes.ts compiles the gather module TWICE behind a prepended `const GATHER_STRATA`
  (`pFG/pFGR` false = the module exactly as it was, `__png`-hash-identical to main; `pFGs/pFGRs` true) and the encode picks the pair each frame, so it flips live; NOT hash-identical when on
  (a different sample pattern). THE TRACE LAB (`tools/qa/trace-lab.js` → `__tl`, kernels `src/render/shaders/trace_lab.wgsl` served from disk, `tools/qa/gpu-quiet.sh`):
  `?trace=N` → `render/frame.ts traceConfig` → `const TRACE_VARIANT` at the head of the scene prelude (only 0 = today's walk exists on main — the branch's V1‥V8 / H1 traversal variants were
  negative results and were not merged; a new experiment adds `…V<N>` copies of occluded / occludedT / traceClosest + three thin `switch (TRACE_VARIANT)` dispatchers and the lab finds them);
  `__hotCommon` / `__scenePrelude` / `__traceConfig` / `__commonSource` / `__daylight` in main.ts, `rc.hotSwap`, `particles.hotSwapSim`; `__tl.scene('B1'‥'B5') / points / bench / exact /
  profile / ab / aa / idHash / matrix` = Mrays/s of one ray class through one query per variant, bit-exactness counters, the reference walk's per-ray counters, interleaved frame A/Bs.
  THE GATHER'S BOUNCE READ IS BOUNDED (08-12, docs/internal/render-defects-0812.md §3, rig `tools/qa/rd-scenes.js`): every secondary-hit cache read in fgather.wgsl goes through
  `lighting_common diceIrradianceFrom(Ph, n, P0, N0)` — one probe spacing off the hit face like any dice read, but never past the plane of the surface the ray LEFT (P0, N0), and no trilinear
  neighbour from behind that plane (they collapse to the home cell) — the fix for indirect light 'leaking' behind the manager's shelves (the cartons' backs 12 cm off the wall read the lit
  storage room next door: 26–50 → 5); a new bounce read at a hit takes the receiver's plane the same way, never the bare `diceIrradiance(Ph + n·1 m)`.
- **The denoiser** (renderer v3 phase 3) — `settings.denoiser` `'v3'` default | `'legacy'`, `?legacydenoise`; one core (`render/shaders/denoise.wgsl`), three clients (shadow / diffuse / specular); `__dn`, `__hotDenoise`, debug view 13 — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.

<!-- was CLAUDE.md lines 2979–3015 -->
- **Smoke = one pool of bricks** (THE smoke solver since 2026-10-10, no switch; the maintainer on the eight 64³ boxes it replaced: "let's just remove the box smoke if this is the way we want to do it" · "we can always revive from
  git history" — the last commit with both solvers is 1530281c, the pool there behind `?sparsesmoke`; notebook docs/internal/sparse-smoke.md, page docs/review/sparse-smoke.html; the names `smoke.sparse`, `SPG_* / spg*`, sparse-lab.js are the prototype's, kept):
  `src/smoke/smoke.ts SmokeSystem` + `smoke.wgsl` + `smokeGrid.ts`: the boxes' solver step on ONE level-wide lattice per voxel size (fine 2.2 cm gun gas, coarse 5.5 cm cans and dust) cut into 8³-cell
  BRICKS that exist only where smoke is (+ `ring` cells of air), one pool of 4096 (`?smokepool=N`, 256‥8192, read once at boot; `?sparsesmoke=N` still reads as that, bare it does nothing), page table / free list / live list / 27-neighbour tables all made on the GPU, 17 + 2 × pairs dispatches a step whatever the
  plume count; every reader goes through `shaders/smoke_read.wgsl`, appended to the scene prelude (r32uint page texture at scene binding 14 + an rgba16float atlas of 10³ blocks at 8; binding 7 = `array<SmokeBound, 8>`, GPU-made; binding 11 is free; shadow rays + the probe walk bricks, the view
  marches walk ≤ 4 bounds per level). No domain count, no faces, no edge fade, nothing for game code to count (`stats.live` = the pool in 512-brick units for the recorder's column; no rule reads it); the limit is total VOLUME (soft ceiling from 60 % of the pool, sooner and harder far from the camera's focus: `viewBias` / `viewR` round `engine.viewFocus`).
  WHAT WENT WITH THE BOXES: `pressure_half.wgsl`, `smoke_lab.wgsl` + tools/qa/smoke-lab.js (`__sl`), `dust_look_sparse.wgsl` (dust_look.wgsl is that text now), FrameFlags `SmokeRenderSkip` + `settings.smokeRenderSkip`, `Caps.smokeFull` / `fullRateDomains`, `CHAOS.puffDomains`, `SmokeSystemLike.unbounded`,
  seven Tab rows (CAP domains, both skip-empty-bricks, flush ε, pressure at half res, fine / coarse voxel).
  ROUND TWO (10-10, each a knob of `__smoke.sparse` and a row of
  Tab ▸ Volumetrics ▸ Smoke pool, each off = the pool as first benched at 3781d45; `__spl.asBenched()` = all off; notebook §9): WHO STEPS = per BRICK, a brick whose fastest air crosses ≤ `params.calmCells` cells (`farCells` 1 out of sight; 2 left nearly twice the smoke hanging at 7 s: a brick that steps less often loses less, notebook §9.1)
  waits 1 / 2 / 4 frames (`calmMax`; 1 = off) and then integrates what it sat out, never past `dtCap` 1/12 s, the shortest wait of its 27 neighbours, a source wakes what it reaches; the whole pool is dispatched directly from `directAt` of it
  stepping. READS HOP (`readSkip`, SHIPS OFF since the Mac's take: eight pairs, no time saved): shadow rays, the lit marches and the froxels skip stretches the page says are clear (`smokeClearRun` / `smokeAnyIn` over a macro map) — same samples, same answers. WHO GIVES WAY (`fresh` 0.15; 0 = first
  come): as the last 2 × fresh of the pool fills, what counts as thin rises, haze is refused the last slots, keeps less air and is let go sooner; nothing evicted, nothing for game code to count. WHAT IS IN A CELL: one word per
  coarse cell (share not canister smoke, 1 − tint) carried along the density's backtrace; `publish` lays `densityScale` / `fxDensityScale` and the tint into the atlas texel, so the two Tab rows act on smoke in the air (frozen too:
  `refreshDomains` → `publishAll`), every reader incl. the guards' probe takes the same `.x`, and the dust twin reads `shaders/dust_look.wgsl`. GUN GAS LETS GO (`fineDecay` 3 /s, `fineShare` 0.25; 0 and 1 = as benched; §9.8): a fine brick is a fifteenth of a coarse one's volume and nothing eats gun gas any more, so 1.7 s on AUTO
  held two thirds of the pool; now thin gas on the fine lattice and the heat in it fade faster, its floors are higher and its air ring smaller (`fineEps / fineHeat / fineRing`, live only while `fineDecay` > 0), and that lattice has a share of the pool that
  stretches to what the coarse one leaves under `softLo` (haze refused from 0.7 of it, all but sources at all of it; counted apart from a dry pool's refusals: `stats.fineHeld`). `tools/qa/sparse-reads.js` (`__spr.run()` = page loads / atlas fetches / march turns per ray hopping or not, `__spr.at(points)` = what a reader is handed). GPU time (the maintainer's Mac, 10-10, high 734 × 770, one run a solver; notebook §5, docs/perf/sparse-lab-*-mac-1010.json): solver ≈ 0.37 ms + 0.45 µs a brick, pool full 2.16 ms / +3.00 union against eight boxes' 2.83 / +3.68, one can in the open peaks at 2029 bricks = 1.31 ms, ≈ +1.5 ms of union over its box; the look: 'big plumes of smoke are sick' (the maintainer, the compound on hard, four cans). `tools/qa/sparse-lab.js` (`__spl.run()`, a fresh boot a run: 1 / 4 / 8 / 12 cans, then one can through its 32 s burn) is the bench; `__spl.round2()` flips each round-two lever in place on five standing scenes, then stages the dry pool, then a magazine on AUTO with the gun-gas rule and without. `__smoke.sparse` = its knobs. Round two on his Mac (10-10, notebook §9.7, docs/perf/sparse-lab2-*-mac-1010.json): solver 0.43 ms + 0.39 µs a brick that STEPS, twelve cans 1.66–1.70 ms / +2.2 to +2.6 union (round one 2.16 / +3.00), a can late in its burn 0.98–1.05 (1.25–1.31); 8192 = 81 % more smoke for +3.85 to +4.02 and 255.5 MiB, so the pool stays 4096; four cans at once already sit on the soft ceiling (~3,150 bricks). A solver-only run on a page that
  has rendered a frame still carries that frame's WIND records (`smoke.setWind([], 3)` first).
- **Prototype branches — NOT merged** (as of August, except the particle rain: `game/rainFx.ts`, `?prain`, `settings.particleRain` default off and the Frame's 832 B ARE in the build now; fire and water are still not in `src/`; each in its worktree with its own dev server; flag absent = main hash for hash, proven in its notebook; review page published as an Artifact):

  Design docs on main awaiting one-line decisions: docs/design/level-scripting.md (levels as FOLDERS with a `script.ts` per level against a typed Director API — generator beats, name-bound
  marks / volumes with define-time lint, stimulus verbs that hand destruction a CAUSE never a result, showcase-only camera / puppet verbs — a workbench Director mode, M1 = the breach as a
  script) and docs/research/destruction-survey.md (glass that GIVES from a per-pane impact Voronoi, a fixture swinging on its cable, jointed furniture; beats scripted Seoul-style, breakage
  only from real rounds). NEXT per the maintainer ('later'): fire propagation + extinction by water / rain AS PHYSICS — species + Arrhenius heat release + droplet evaporation inside the
  existing solver domains (Fire-X, TOG 2025, itself wgpu / WGSL); water bodies stay heightfields, airborne water = particles / SPH-lite with a conservative hand-off (Chentanez & Müller 2010).

<!-- added 2026-10-13, after the cut -->
- **Wet ground breaks up into pools and damp aggregate** (`settings.wetBreakup` 0‥1, default 1; `?nowetbreak` = 0 = the frame as it was; Tab ▸ Materials ▸ '· wet ground break-up'; the small flaws
  goal, commit 2a41e5b5; PICTURE ONLY): under the storm every open ground slab took one finish (roughness 0.22, stretched), which the reflection pass drew as a near mirror across the view. The
  g-buffer now varies that roughness over the ground in world space (`detail.wgsl wetGround`, read in gbuffer.wgsl whatever the detail layer's amount): about +0.04 in the low spots, +0.15 on the
  stone between them. Dry gloss floors are untouched. The amount rides `frame.rtCfg.z` as the anisotropy + 2 × tenths (reflect.wgsl / reflect_p5.wgsl take the anisotropy back out: keep the two
  in step). The sender's claim, not re-checked here: seen only on the software adapter.
- **Lasers and tracers show in the ray-traced reflections** (`settings.beamReflect`, default on, acts only with `rtReflect`; `?nobeamreflect` = no segment handed over, the pass's frame as it
  was; Tab ▸ Materials ▸ '· lasers & tracers in reflections'; the small flaws goal, commit 29dd44b8; PICTURE ONLY): a beam is a NoShadow box no ray can meet, so the reflection pass never saw
  one. `engine.ts` hands `passes.setBeams(world.dynamics, thinIs, viewFocus)` the frame's thin lines (the boxes `game/thinline.ts thinNote` noted: combat.ts `beamBoxes`, tracers.ts) as line
  segments — up to eight, nearest the view — in a small UNIFORM at the reflection pass's binding 11 (not a storage buffer: the scene group's budget is untouched), and reflect.wgsl /
  reflect_p5.wgsl add each one's image where the mirror ray passes it, behind one occlusion ray. No beam on the frame = a zero count = nothing added. A beam is still never a light and still
  in nobody's eye or meter (the one-model rule of the IR lasers bullet stands).
- **Squad lasers are light in the air** (`settings.beamAir`, PICTURE ONLY, default ON; `?nobeamair` / Tab '· squad lasers as light in the air' = the glowing boxes exactly as before; debug views show the
  boxes; the maintainer, 10-13, floodlit at night in rain under the tube: "the lasers do feel a bit nonphysical", then "it's a bit bright given the brightness of the IR beam"). Cause: a laser was an
  emissive BOX floored at a pixel wide, which the tube's log curve clips to white: every beam one flat 4 px white bar end to end, its 2 cm bead lost in it, blind to rain and smoke. The game's boxes
  are untouched (`thinline.ts thinAir` marks a weapon laser's line and its bead; `passes.ts setBeams` hides them from the primary view through `BoxWorld.hidePrimary` and hands ≤ 8 segments to
  composite group 1 binding 15); `composite.wgsl beamAir` adds a Gaussian line (σ = max(2.2 mm, 0.55 px)) of the beam's light × an AIR SHARE, a dot where it lands (gain 3.5, r 9 mm, halo 0.07,
  not scaled by the air) and a glint at the emitter. Air share = `beamAirK` × (0.03 + 0.09 × haze/0.035, haze capped at 2×) = 0.12 by default, + 0.25 × rain and a sparkle on drops outdoors, + up
  to 3 in smoke (read per pixel). A line whose far end is under the ground is cut AT the ground and given its dot (the game's `laserReach` does not meet the yard's floor: such a beam had no dot
  in either look; the IR laser's owner's, not mended in the game). No `FROZEN_HOLDS` row and no journal line: nothing in a step reads it. MEASURED on the software adapter (SwiftShader, verylow,
  floodlit's storm, tube on, 5 lasers, live flips on one page): boxes = core 255, +79 over the wet ground, 94 % of the line ≥ 250; air share 0.565 (the first cut) = the same level, 69 % ≥ 250; air
  share 0.265 (about what ships in that rain) = peak 226, +54, 9 % ≥ 250 (the sparkle beads), dot 10–12 px at half height against a 2 px line. Pipelines 112/112, 0 GPU errors at verylow and high.
  NOT measured: clear air (estimate +25–40), the red visible beam, a beam across a depth edge, ultra / medium, motion (the sparkle's flicker). Never seen on a GPU: the maintainer's to judge.
- **Wet ground mirrors alike at every tier; a laser's mirror image follows the beam** (`settings.wetMirror`, PICTURE ONLY, default ON; `?nowetmirror` / Tab '· wet ground mirrors the men'; the
  maintainer, same shot: "we don't really see reflections of the characters"). Men ARE in the traced reflections (round-cone proxies in `traceClosest`, shaded with direct light and a shadow ray,
  the first 8 men only: `BoxWorld.addCharacterCapsules`), but `reflect.wgsl` gave the wet lot a dry finish's Fresnel (4 % from this camera) where the gloss path of low / verylow multiplies it by
  (1 + 2.5 × wetness) × 0.85, and the laser's image had a floor of its own (35 % × 1.5): a bright beam image beside men too faint to read. Now traced hits on `aniso` (wet) ground take
  min(F × (1 + 2 × wetness), 1) (the lamps' analytic glints are as they were), `beams.k.y` carries the 2 (0 = off: the arithmetic as it was), and an air-look laser mirrors at
  max(that, `BEAM_REFL_AIR` 0.25) × its air share, gain 1. KEEP IN STEP: reflect.wgsl ≡ reflect_p5.wgsl. MEASURED (SwiftShader, high, 6–12 frames of history only, 115–140 s a frame): the old
  beam image +11 over ground, the new one at the ground's own noise; NO man-shaped image readable with the switch on or off. So the men are 3× stronger than they were and still faint under
  the tube: dark wet kit (albedo 0.12) × 12 % against lit ground, then the log curve. Making them READ needs a drawn floor like the laser's had (a taste call, put to the maintainer), not
  more physics. Defenders past the 8-proxy table have no image and no shadow at all (a separate, bigger job). Never seen on a GPU.
- **The scene group's binding 11 is the fog of war's sight table, and `evalLight` asks it (10-14, `FOG.full` — `stealth.md`).** `common.wgsl`: `evalLight` =
  `evalLightRaw` (the old body) × `lightFogK` for a light whose kind word carries bit 25 / 26 (none while the rule or the fog is off: one `and` a light);
  `evalLightTrue` = the light as it is, for the game's readings (`probe.wgsl` alone). A NEW PLACE THAT WORKS A LIGHT OUT WITHOUT `evalLight` MUST MULTIPLY BY
  `lightFogK` (today: the glints in `reflect.wgsl` ≡ `reflect_p5.wgsl`, `cards.wgsl`, `froxel.wgsl`, the march's K-beam pick) — `probes.ts fog-full` reads the
  text for these and fails on any other file calling `evalLightRaw`. `fogSeenAt` walks the grid, so the VERTEX stage uses `fogSeenBins`. The table is a 58 KB (41 KB until 10-24, when the fog took five eyes; `FOG.eyes`, `docs/agents/stealth.md`)
  uniform (the 5th of 12 a stage may bind with the composite group's) written as storage by `fogsight.wgsl` at the head of the frame, bound through a second
  scene group (`sceneBGPlain`, a zero stand-in at 11). Sampled textures: the composite stage is at 15 of 16 (13 + the smoke atlas + the smoke page — the note
  at `passes.ts lComp` still says 14). Compiles on the software adapter (105 programs, 0 failed); never run on a GPU.

- **A shader module's text is cut to what it uses (2026-10-19, a play test: fifteen seconds and more of shader compiles on a fast Windows machine, "compiling the same shaders over
  and over", hitches while it does).** `src/gpu/wgslTrim.ts SHADER_TRIM` (ON; `?shadertrim=0` = every module whole, as it was — a switch of the page, not a rule of the game: no knob,
  no `FROZEN_HOLDS` row, both stands boot the same Engine). Every scene module is compiled behind `render/frame.ts scenePrelude()` — some 150 KB and 350 declarations in front of a
  kernel that may read a twentieth of it — and the head of that prelude holds the level's compile-time switches (the weather kinds, snow, the glass, the cut boxes), so a level of
  another family changed the TEXT of every module though most kernels never read the switch. `gpu/device.ts makeShader` (and the one boot module `passes.ts` makes itself, the dust
  volume's) now hands the browser `shaderText(code)`: the module-scope declarations an entry point reaches by name, in their order and character for character (comments aside);
  every entry point, `override`, directive and `const_assert` always stays, and text with no entry point comes back whole. Hot-swap and viewer modules are left whole.
  **Counted** (`tools/qa/shader-count-page.cjs`, the real page on the software adapter at medium, a walk of five pages: the title, the compound's kit picture, the compound, the
  block, the pass): the title is 66 modules, 12.1 MB of WGSL before and 3.3 MB after (73 % less); the same 150 pipelines either way (130 asynchronous + the three radiance-cascade
  ones before ready, 17 after), 118 of 118 counted in by the card, none failed, no GPU error on the console of any page. Module texts NEW to the browser on each page of the walk
  (not made, character for character, by an earlier page), before → after: the title 64 → 63 · the kit picture of a first mission 57 of 64 → 26 of 63 · that mission 2 → 2 · a
  second level of its family 0 → 0 · a snow level 58 of 66 → 13 of 65. Pipelines whose every stage an earlier page had made: 39 of 142 → 104 of 142 for the first mission, 41 of
  146 → 129 of 146 for the snow level. What still differs is what really reads a switch: thirteen modules read `WX_KINDS` (the title's office is the one family with it off), six
  to thirteen the snow's, one carries the level's own mesh-tree sizes. A quality change (medium → high on the title) made no module and no pipeline in the six seconds watched.
  `tools/qa/shadertrim-check.ts` (the Engine booted on a recording stand-in, whole and cut: same modules, order kept, every root kept, nothing left that mentions a dropped name,
  cutting twice changes nothing; a level whose weather switch differs is 10 new texts of 35 where it was 30; `SHADERTRIM_BREAK=1` must fail) — one Engine, so one stand's worth; it
  passes under `TPS_PROFILE=shipped` the same. `window.__boot.shaderText {modules, before, after, ms}` and `.slowest` (the six boot pipelines that came back last) are on the boot
  line; the benchmark's text carries them under `load`, with a `loads` row of every scene's own load (the first compiles cold, the later ones show what the browser kept).
  **The picture, cut against whole** (`tools/qa/draw-equal.cjs` on one build, the switch passed through its quality word: `--quality 'medium&shadertrim=0'`; 320×180, medium, the
  software adapter): the rain view and the squad view are EQUAL pixel for pixel at both checkpoints. One trap in reading it: the fog-of-war pass makes its pipeline on first use,
  so on the squad view the second drawn frame has that pass or not by how fast the compile came back (one cut run had it, a second cut run and the whole run did not: those two
  are equal); `&nofow` on both sides takes the race out, and is equal at both checkpoints.
  **Never seen on a GPU.** That a driver's compile gets shorter, that the browser's shader cache now answers a second level's modules, and that the hitches go with the text are INFERENCES — the next
  benchmark text from the Windows machine is the measure (`load`, `loads`, `longest freeze`).
- **What is left of the shader wait, and needs a GPU to do (2026-10-19).** (1) Compile first what the opened quality draws: the boot waits for all ~133 pipelines though a tier
  takes a part of them (the legacy and v3 denoiser chains, every à-trous variant, both composite kinds are all made). The count tool prints which boot pipelines a pass took in the
  seconds after ready, but on the software adapter a frame is half a minute, so its list is a floor, not the set — the split needs a machine that draws, and every pipeline left
  for later needs its pass to stand down until it is in. (2) Module creation is one burst: sixty `createShaderModule` calls in one task, parsed back to back on the browser's GPU
  thread (the likely "longest freeze" of the benchmark's load row; the cut makes that burst a quarter of the text); spreading them over frames means an `await` between passes in
  `Engine.init`. (3) `render/rc.ts rebuildRc` makes its three pipelines synchronously at boot and at every quality change (identical text: the implementation's cache answers a
  repeat). (4) The Game's own build is one block of the page's thread (0.9 s here in the browser): the mesh shadows' BVH and the reach derivation are most of it
  (`render/meshShadows.ts`, `game/reach.ts`), with `math/hyp.ts`'s trial at module load beside them; the benchmark's `game built in` says what it is on a real machine.
- **The outline in the dark** (`render/outline.ts`, `shaders/outline.wgsl`; 2026-10-20): one scissored, blended triangle onto the composite after the fog of
  war and before the resolve, reading the G-buffer's id and depth targets, made only while the player's Options row is on. What it is for, what it costs
  and what nobody has seen: `docs/agents/menus.md`, "Finding your own man". A pass that wants whose-pixel-is-this can take it as its model: the owner byte
  is bits 20 to 27 of the id target on a character's mesh and on every box emitted for him.
- **The bounce is never read through a wall off a man (`BOUNCE_WALLS`, the scene prelude's const — `render/frame.ts bounceWallsConfig`, ON; `?nobouncewalls` at boot = every
  read as it was; no game table, nothing for a recording to carry, the same on both stands).** The maintainer, 10-20, the pass at night, the squad in the snow against
  the tea room's outer wall, the debugger's direct / specular / indirect views: "i think there's some leak on direct and specular and indirect with the wall here", and
  "also happens on this side too". WHAT IT WAS: the radiance cache (`diceIrradiance`, a 1 m lattice) is read a probe spacing along a face's normal — sound for a wall,
  and for a man stood by a wall the room behind it. (1) Indirect: a gather ray that HIT a man read the room off his side that faces the wall; a ray that LEFT a man (or
  the lip of a boot print: a shading normal well off a box face's own) for the wall was bounded by `diceIrradianceFrom` as if the plane it left were a wall, and
  "the cell centre is behind it: step to the cell on its side" stepped the read into the room. (2) Specular: a coat's sheen (`composite.wgsl wetCoatSpec`) mirrored
  the cache a spacing along the man's normal: the room's lamps on his rims. (3) Direct: nothing found — the reach masks drop the room's lights from the cells outside
  (dumped for the pass: level 0 in every cell beyond the walls), what his direct view shows is the moon; the few warm specks on the men's rims there are NOT explained.
  THE RULE: `lighting_common.wgsl diceWalledPoint(Ph, n, skip)` — the read point a spacing along n, stopped 5 cm short of the NEAREST box on that line (`occludedTBoxes`
  answers the first box it meets, the ground before a wall: it is asked again short of each answer; men's proxies are not asked, and `skip` names up to two men whose
  carried boxes are not either — his own gun must not hide the air from him), then a box ray to the centre of each of its four plan cells: the read keeps all four,
  else the one column / row / cell it sees, and where it sees none there is NO read (dark, never the room). Asked where the hit is a man or a box he carries
  (`bounceHitMan`: the gather's rays, the ray-traced reflections' hit shading, the cache's own probes in `hitRadiance`; NOT the gather program's own gloss and pane
  rays, which keep the old read: below), where the surface a gather ray
  left is no wall (`bounceLeftNoWall`: a man's pixel; within 2 m, a normal more than a dozen degrees off every axis), and for the sheen. Everything else reads as before (since 10-23 a metal's reflection rays ask it too: REFL WALLS, the next bullet).
  THE SOFTWARE ADAPTER'S ROOM (10-20, the same day: the build with the rule lost its GPU device — "A valid external Instance reference no longer exists", the GPU
  process dead of a segfault — on the first frame a CUT piece was alive: a wall charge in `soundlanes-page.cjs`'s walk, a bang entry that broke cover). The software
  adapter builds a copy of a function for every place it is written, the read wrote `occludedTBoxes` in three places and the gather asked the read in five: fifteen
  more box walks in the gather's program, each with the cut test inside in the cut twin (`render/cutSwap.ts`), and that twin no longer ran. Bisected on the blown-wall
  still (`node tools/qa/cut-stills.cjs --root . --out <dir> --tag after --cut --scene wall --cam near --quality verylow --w 320 --h 180 --settle 3 --physics 30`, ten
  minutes a run, one run each): rule in the probes alone clean, probes + sheen clean, gather + reflections dead; the walk written ONCE (five more walks in the gather)
  clean at verylow and high; a second written walk (ten) dead. So the read's loop asks ONE written walk up to eight times, and the gather's gloss and pane rays (a man
  mirrored in a floor or a pane) went back to the old read: three more walks. THE RULE FOR WHOEVER EDITS `fgather.wgsl` NEXT: its cut twin is within a handful of
  written box walks of what the software adapter runs; after adding a trace, draw that still. Nobody knows whether any real GPU has such a limit (none was reported).
  `?nobouncewalls` rides a replay page's address (`ui/replaykey.ts VISIT_FLAGS`).
  NOT MENDED: the light meter (`probe.wgsl`) reads the cache AT the man, blended over the cells around him — by a lit room's wall some are the room's (the meter's
  owner's; untouched here). The firefly cap of the reflections (`Eref`) still reads the old point. COST: five to eight short box rays per asked read — every pixel of a
  man for the sheen, his gather rays, and near rays off steep snow or yawed boxes; never timed on a GPU.
  CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts bouncewalls` (family `render`; `BOUNCEWALLS_BREAK=1` fails 3 of its first 5 lines; its last 3 are REFL WALLS'; both stands): the shader's rule and every site held by
  their text, and a TypeScript copy (its ray is the nearest box, as the shader's ask-again loop) weighed for men stood 0.33 to 0.9 m off every ceiling-high wall of all
  50 levels, a shin's down-turned skin among the points — reads that blend a cell beyond a wall 42.8 % → 14 of 1.46 M (the pass's tea room: 44.5 % of skin points and
  40.5 % of rays to the wall → 0; a print's lip at the wall's foot 165 of 500 → 0, the 100 that lean 0.15 clean either way and not asked). No shader runs there.
  PAGE: the final text compiled on the software adapter (the pass, squad of four, hard, medium and high quality: 119 of 119 pipelines, no GPU error on the console). STILLS there (one seed, 783×500 at half scale,
  five men stood at the tea room's west wall, the lean-to's bulb put out so the yard has the moon alone, `?nobouncewalls` against the page as it opens, the same
  frames each): the indirect view's men had orange flanks on the side that faces the wall and the snow at the wall's foot an orange streak — pixels redder than blue
  by 6 of 255 on the men's wall side 1623 → 1, on the strip of snow 592 → 1; the spec view's orange rims 1261 → 15; the men stay moon-blue, not black. Eight frames,
  not converged. Never seen on a GPU: the picture in motion, the cost, and whether a man's dark side reads too dark where the walled point sees one cell.
- **A metal never mirrors the room behind a wall (`REFL_WALLS`, the scene prelude's const — `render/frame.ts reflWallsConfig`, ON; `?noreflwalls` at boot = the rule
  off; no game table, no journal line, no `FROZEN_HOLDS` row: nothing in the update reads it and the headless stands draw nothing)** (10-23). The maintainer, the solo
  night's manager's office at high, one desk lamp lit: "some weird light leakage on bookshelf? seems like irradiance cache leak through wall? and showing up in
  specular?" — the steel shelving on the partition to the lit storage room glowed a dull orange, and only debug view 10 (specular) showed it. CAUSE: a ray-traced
  reflection shades its hit with `diceIrradiance(Ph + hit.n × c0Spacing(), hit.n)`. For a hit on a wall the spacing leads into the room. For a hit whose normal runs
  ALONG a partition within half a cell of it (a shelf board, the floor at the wall's foot, the ceiling over it, an upright's side) the read stays by the wall and its
  four plan cells straddle it: with the wall on the metre lattice the share of the cells beyond is 0.5 less the distance to the wall's line, 0.1 to 0.27 on that unit's
  boards and 0.44 at the wall's foot. A dielectric shows a few per cent of its mirror at this camera; a metal shows all of it (F0 = its paint, and composite steps a
  metal's diffuse back 70 %), so the steel glowed and the cartons on it did not. The 08-12 mend (`diceIrradianceFrom`) is the gather's and bounds a read by the plane
  the ray LEFT; it was never asked by the reflections ("listed for a follow-up if a case shows") and would not have held this one: the wall is neither plane.
  THE RULE: a metal pixel's reflection rays (`metalness > 0.25` in `reflect.wgsl` / `reflect_p5.wgsl` main) shade every hit with the walled read
  (`diceWalledPoint`: stopped short of the nearest box along the normal, the footprint held to the cells the point can see, no read where it sees none), the reflecting
  pixel's owner in the skip word; every other pixel's rays keep the read they had. The box walk is written no more often than before (the sites that asked it for a
  hit on a man now also take the metal's word), so the software adapter's program is no bigger. `?nobouncewalls` alone no longer gives the picture from before both
  rules where a man is mirrored in steel: that takes both words. `?noreflwalls` rides a replay page's address (`VISIT_FLAGS`).
  NOT MENDED: the same blend in the DIFFUSE gather's hits for rays that did not leave that wall (× the look's indirect scale 0.35, and not seen in his indirect view);
  the gather's gloss and pane mirror reads (low and verylow trace no reflections; that program has no room for a fourth walled site); a pane's mirror
  (`diceMeanRadiance(Pg + Rg × 0.6)`); the light meter (`probe.wgsl` reads the cache at the man: no LIGHT number moves with this switch, the reflections are picture
  only); phase 5's hit-lighting reuse (`rtHitReuse`, off on every preset) keys its record by box and place, not by which read made it. THE GENERAL MEND, proposed and
  not built: the cache writes, per cell, which of its plan neighbours its centre can see (a few short box rays where it already traces hundreds, so doors and blown
  walls follow), and `diceIrradiance` itself holds its footprint to those — every reader mended with no rays at the read, this rule and BOUNCE WALLS' rays retired.
  COST: five to eight short box rays more for each ray of a metal pixel (steel shelving, lockers, door leaves, the GWOT kit's sheet metal; two rays a pixel on ultra);
  never timed on a GPU. RISK, from the review's count on the check's own model: away from walls the walled read also moves 15 % of floor reads that never leaked
  (stopped short of furniture, or one line to a cell blocked by a desk leg) and 3 % of wall-face reads see no cell and go dark, so a steel face may show a step or a
  dark patch in its mirror of clutter. Never seen on a GPU.
  CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts bouncewalls` (family `render`), its last three lines; `REFLWALLS_BREAK=1` fails two of them; both stands. The text of the rule in
  both passes, the prelude and the flag; and the same TypeScript copy of the read weighed for faces that look up (the floor, a board's height) or down (the ceiling)
  6 to 40 cm off every ceiling-high wall of all 56 levels, the boxes turned a quarter put back so the shelving's own boards stop the walk: reads that blend a cell
  beyond a wall 195,120 of 292,051 (66.8 %) → 0, with 1.0 % seeing no cell (dark); at the office's partition 397 of 508 → 0, 24 dark. No shader runs there.
  PAGE (the software adapter, one seed, 640×360 with 492×277 inside at high, `?solo&paused&quality=high&mute`, the camera pinned on the unit from the office side, 24
  frames, `?noreflwalls` against the page as it opens): the final text compiled and drew with no GPU or page error. The specular view at exposure × 4, in display
  levels of 255: the uprights' inner faces 19.4 → 0.7 (their brightest point 53 → 2), the lowest board's top 6.3 → 1.0, the next 1.6 → 0.7, the top board 4.7 → 3.4,
  the unit's whole rectangle on screen 4.08 → 1.70 in the mean and 11.7 → 2.4 at its ninetieth percentile; in the final frame the uprights 3.1 → 0.3 and the lowest
  board 1.4 → 0.3; the indirect view is the same to the digit at every point (the diffuse is not touched). What stays, the same with the switch either way, is a warm
  streak on the front edges of the top two boards: read as the desk lamp's own highlight (inferred, not traced). No step or dark patch showed in that one view. Never
  seen on a GPU: the picture in motion, the cost, and steel anywhere but this unit.
- **The flame's sample count is a number** (`FIRE.look.steps`, 40; the look row's fifteenth float, `K.d.z`; `?firesteps=N`, 4 to 64; a row in `/firelab`;
  `LOOK='steps=12'` in `tools/qa/fire-lab.cjs`). No rule and no switch: 40 is the count the shader had, and a recording from before the key gets 40. It is
  there for a TIMING: the flame's price is the count × the pixels it covers, at sigma 2.5 no ray goes opaque so none stops early, and a model (nobody's
  timing) puts the flame over its bar at the closest zoom at High. On a real GPU, compare the page as it opens with `&firesteps=18` and `&firesteps=24`
  for the price and for bands in the flame. Checked: the shader compiles and draws at 40 and at 12 on the software adapter, shader alone (the same flame, a
  faint stipple at 12); `fire-check`'s look line carries the count. NEVER SEEN OR TIMED ON A GPU; the whole page was not booted.
- **An open fire burns (`src/game/fire.ts FIRE`, `render/shaders/fire.wgsl`; 2026-10-23, the maintainer: "we gotta improve our fire! we have barrels with fire on them …
  great fire with smoke and crackles and dynamic lighting would look sick").** Until now such a drum was a glowing lid and a steady lamp. A level light whose id starts
  with `brazier` is a fire (`pass.json` and `tut-sky.json` have one each; `docs/level-format.md`, the lights row). SWITCH: `FIRE.on`, ON in the page (`?fire=0` = the
  lid and the steady lamp), OFF in the module and on the frozen stand (`TPS_FIRE=1`); its table rides the journal and a recording from before the key replays with it off.
  THE FLUID SOLVER IS USED FOR THE SMOKE AND NOT FOR THE FLAME: a flame is 40 cm across and changes shape in a tenth of a second, the solver's cells are 5.5 cm and it
  publishes density, not heat, to the picture — a flame made of it would be seven cells wide, cost bricks at every preset and still need a shader to colour it; smoke is
  what the solver is for (it climbs, leans in the wind, pools under a roof, is lit by every lamp and shadowed).
  THE LIGHT is the level's own lamp, no new light: its strength × `fireFlicker` (smooth noise at five rates 0.43‥8.3 Hz + a kick with each crack of the wood: 0.69 to
  1.37 of the authored 9 over twenty seconds, mean 0.985, RMS about 0.15, never under `least` 0.6 or over `most` 1.6), its place lifted `lift` 0.25 m into the flame (the
  level hangs it 16 cm over a lid 58 cm wide: from there the lid is lit white and a flame is lost on it) and wandering 6 cm, and while it burns the emitter is `size`
  1.1 of the mouth's radius, the flame's own reach (0.24 m on the pass's drum; the level's 6 cm pinpoint drew the drum's own shadow as a black disc a metre round it:
  SEEN ON A GPU, below; `size` 0 = the level's, `?firesize=0` in the page, to compare on a GPU; the level's size is back the frame the fire is out or the switch goes
  off, and a recording from before the key replays with `size` 0. A level's own radius is kept when it is the bigger). WHO READS IT: the light meter of a man
  beside it and every caller of `lightEstimateAt` that does not ask for the steady light (the review of the second cut listed three that ask what a PLACE lights and
  so read the flicker: `guards.ts litPlace`'s dark test, `doortools.ts thrLitCell`, kept for the order, and `nvg.ts nvgPlaceLight` — a cell near `LIGHTS.litAt`
  beside a fire can fall either side by the flicker's phase; they also count flashes, so handing them `steadyOnly` is their owners' call and was not made here).
  The steady readers — `lightEstimateAt(…, steadyOnly)` (the calm torch, the dark-floor and dark-door rules) is handed the AUTHORED lamp where the level hung
  it and the size the level gave it through `RtLight.steady` (guards.ts; the fog of war's remembered lamp likewise), the same number every frame as with the switch off (the check's `steady` line, bit for bit).
  THE FLAME, THE BED OF COALS AND THE EMBERS are drawn by the composite (`fireOver`, beside the lasers' light in the air; records in the beams uniform, `passes.ts
  setFires`, four fires at most, the nearest the view): a marched volume 24 steps deep that hides what is behind it within three fingers (`FIRE_SIGMA` 14 /m; 18 steps at 20 /m was a stipple, a pixel against its four
  neighbours 0.036 in the lab where the first cut was 0.015: this is 0.019), each tongue yellow at its root, orange up its length and red
  at its tip (`fireColor`, written as scene radiance and kept under the tone curve's shoulder: red from 0.4, orange 1.6, the yellow heart 2.1, a tenth more when the
  light kicks); a
  disc of char and deep orange gaps over the lid; ten embers climbing and six thrown by each crack, closed forms of the game's clock (nothing kept between frames: a replay
  draws the same fire). PICTURE ONLY.
  THE THIRD CUT (2026-10-23, the maintainer's second look on a GPU, with stills of a fluid-simulated camp fire as the target: "still very ugly. needs more
  dynamic range, smoke, embers, movement, could we do heat distortion?"; then "embers can be GPU particles though") REPLACES the paragraph above where they
  differ. The second cut had held the flame's radiance under the tone curve's shoulder, level with the snow it lights: that was the flat pale peach he saw.
  Now the flame is HDR inside and saturated at its skin (`fireColor`: dark red 0.07 at the tips and edge, through 0.3, 0.6, 1.05 and 1.9 of red, to a heart of
  9 × `core`; AgX at the page's exposure puts saturated red and orange between 0.1 and 1 of scene radiance and everything above pale, and the bloom, which has
  no threshold, spreads the heart), marched 32 steps and nearly opaque (`sigma` 12 /m), with distinct tongues (two slow noise reads lick the column sideways,
  a third cuts deep gaps between tongues and streaks the heat), rings that swell and climb about twice a second (`breathe`), a sooty cool edge (`soot`), and a
  column of SMOKE DRAWN STRAIGHT OFF ITS TIPS in the same march (`plume`, ten steps to 3.6 m, lit orange from below: the solver's own plume is look-only, thin
  and starts over a man's head, so by itself it never read as the fire's smoke; `?fireplume=0`). HEAT SHIMMER (`shimmer`, 1.2 cm; `?fireheat=0`): the composite's
  pixel is a pure function of where it is asked (`compositePixel`), so it is asked a little to one side: `fireWarp` sums `fireShimmer` over the fires (the ray's
  closest approach to the column over the flame, two noise reads that climb), nothing when the pixel's own surface is nearer than the column, and never in a
  debug view. THE EMBERS ARE GPU PARTICLES now (`render/particles.ts EmitOpts.ember`: a spark whose colour word's top byte is not 255 — `particles_common.wgsl
  emberIs`; lifted by `EMBER_LIFT` 3.2 m/s² and swirled, carried by the wind in full, drawn by `emberRadiance`, in the bloom like any spark): about `embers` 24
  alight over a fire within 30 m of the view, `emberCrack` 10 more thrown by a crack; filed by the host's book with a seed made by hand, so the game's own die
  and state are untouched (the check's `look` line: a game with a pool and one without differ in nothing); `?fireembers=0` = none; they are not drawn for a
  fire the fog remembers. The record is 64 bytes (no pop list); the look's ten numbers ride behind the four records (`passes.ts setFireLook`, `FireLook`).
  KNOWN, kept: no embers at all where the page has no GPU particles (`?noparticles`: the closed-form embers the composite drew are gone); embers are drawn
  after the composite, so the flame does not hide one behind it and the shimmer does not move them; an ember asks the wind as a puff of dust does (no wind
  record names sparks); the shimmer reads nothing that stands nearer than the column, here or where it would read; the flame thins out under the top of what
  is marched (2.3 × its height) so a kicked tongue is not cut flat; THE DRAWN SMOKE AND THE FLAME ARE PICTURE ONLY (no sight line or sensor knows of them:
  a man behind the column is hidden from the player a little and from nobody else, which bends "one model for picture and AI"; the flame as gas in the smoke
  solver, the maintainer's pick and the next step, is what makes the smoke real; until then `plume` is a slider and `?fireplume=0` a word).
  A recording from before `FIRE.look` replays with no shimmer, no drawn smoke and no embers. THE FIRE LAB: `/firelab` on the dev server
  (`?levelFile=pass.json&roomclear&squad4&nofow&firelab`, `src/host/firelab.ts`, on the sneak lab's pattern): you beside the brazier, nobody able to notice or
  hurt you, every number of the look, the embers, the light and the drifting smoke as a live slider, the build's back by a button, the lot copied out as one line.
  NEVER SEEN ON A GPU: the look was set on the software adapter's stills (`tools/qa/fire-lab.cjs`, which now emulates the bloom and the tone curve: `LOOK='k=v,…'`).
  THE FLAME AS GAS (`FIRE.gas`, OFF in the page until it has been seen: `?firegas=1`, and a row in the fire lab; 2026-10-23, the maintainer on a card asking
  how much of the flame should be real fluid sim: "Drive it from our 3D smoke solver", then "i'm curious how far we can push our existing smoke solver.
  curious if we can make the finer cells work well with our existing brick stuff"). A fire within `viewR` 12 m of the view files a second look-only source
  every half second on the solver's FINE lattice (2.2 cm cells, the breath's and the gun gas's, the same brick pool; `lattice: 'fine'`) at the coals: HEAT
  with next to no smoke in it (`temp` 22, `density` 0.3 a second, leaving at 1.8 m/s). The solver lifts it by its own buoyancy, curls it and leans it in the wind, and the
  picture draws the flame from that heat (`fire.wgsl fireFlameG` through `composite.wgsl fireGas` = `smoke_read.wgsl spgFineHot`): white-hot at `ref`, no
  flame under `lo` of it, the noise only tearing the skin finer than a cell. A fire's record carries how far it has eased to its gas (`FireRecord.gas`, the
  host's book), so a fire far from the view, on a preset that sheds fire smoke or with no solver is the flame of noise; while it is gas the drawn smoke is
  off. TWO CHANGES TO THE SOLVER (`src/smoke`, no thread's own: the last change there was the breath's, 10-20), both nothing while the switch is off:
  (1) HOT GAS ON THE FINE LATTICE IS KEPT — `sparse.fineKeep` (0 = no such rule, the solver as it was; the uniform's spare word): the fine lattice fades
  gas under `thinBelow` 0.25 and the heat in it at up to 3 /s (THE FINE LATTICE LETS GO), which made the first gas flame (drawn from density) a lick whose
  length hung on how dense it was and which lost its lift and lay over 45° in the yard's 0.7 m/s; with the rule a cell hotter than `fineKeep` is not thin
  and cools only at the solver's own 1.2 /s, so the flame's height is its cooling time. The fire raises it (`SmokeSystemLike.keepHot`, `FIRE.gas.keep` 0.8)
  while a fire's flame is gas and puts it back to 0; WHILE IT IS UP gun gas and breath that hot linger as long too (nobody has measured how hot they run).
  (2) A FINE BRICK'S HEAT IS PUBLISHED in its atlas texel's last channel (`publish`; nobody read that channel of a fine brick: `smoke_read.wgsl` is the
  atlas's only reader and takes `.x` of a fine brick), always, switch or no switch: a brick that holds heat and no density was already kept and published
  (its box counts either), so the page and the marches see what they saw. WHAT THE GAS IS TO THE GAME: its little density is the solver's own, so in the
  page a sight line through the flame loses what that smoke takes (thin by design; `density` is a lab slider), and the headless stands have no solver.
  FIRST CUT, kept in the log (d0e94537): the flame drawn from the fine lattice's DENSITY with no solver change; measured in the page (software adapter,
  lines asked of the game's sensors): the published gas ran about a fifth of the source's `density` at the heart, 0.8 a second was a half-metre lick and
  1.6 a metre and a half, the pool read 787 to 896 bricks three seconds in. CHECK: the fire check's `gas` line (heat sources as the table says, the solver
  told to keep hot gas and told to stop, the record's share, none without a solver or put off, an old recording off). IN THE PAGE (software adapter, the
  pass, the storm 0.5 m/s at the drum, five stills): a white heart, orange body, red tip, no haze; one streamer about a metre and a half long that the wind
  leans some 45° and curls (one streamer, not a field of tongues: one soft source, two-centimetre cells); a sensor's line through its heart keeps 0.90 of
  its light, every other line through the flame 0.97 or more; the pool 802 bricks three seconds in (275 fine) and 1,374 six seconds in with `temp` 22
  (445 fine; the pass's own cold smoke and the fire's coarse plume are in those). A gas flame is marched 56 steps (40 and 16 more) in a cylinder up to 0.8 m wider than the
  noise's (`fireGasWide`), so it costs half as much again a pixel over more pixels: not timed. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU, never seen moving.
  UNDER THE FOG OF WAR A FIRE IS DRAWN AS THE TEAM LAST SAW IT (`FIRE.fog`, on; `?firefog=0`; a recording from before the key replays with it
  off; 2026-10-23, the maintainer, playing the pass in plan mode on hard: "weird that fire doesn't show up in fog of war … I think we should at least show
  everything in the environment visible at the start of the level all the time?"). The first cut hid the flame over ground the fog hides, by the fog's rule for
  smoke and flakes; but a fire is part of the place, and the fog's picture (the full picture: the live frame dimmed) already had its lamp lighting the yard
  round a drum with a bare lid. Now a record carries the fog's own memory of the fire's lamp (`FireRecord.fog`, `RtLight.fog`'s numbers; `fireOver` asks
  `fogSeenAt` at the coals only for 1 and 2): burning and known to burn = 0, drawn wherever it stands (the fog pass dims it with its ground); lit where nobody saw
  (`RtLight.fog` 1) = 1, only where the team sees; put out where nobody saw (`fogGhost` up) = a record at full heat for where the team does NOT see, 2, beside the
  lamp's own ghost (which is the level's pinpoint where the level hung it: its shadow has the drawn edge). The records are built by `fireDraws`, which
  game.ts calls AGAIN right behind the fog's turn (`updateFire` runs before it): the frame a fire is put out unseen already draws it burning, not one frame of
  bare lid. KNOWN LIMITS, kept: the fog test is ONE per fire, at the coals, while the fog pass dims a pixel at a time (a flame astride the edge of what the team
  sees is drawn or not as a whole); a fire in the fog still leans on the LIVE wind (a door's gust the team did not see moves it) and flickers on the clock; a
  remembered fire counts toward the four drawn; `fireSummary`'s "drawn" counts it too; `FIRE.fog` has no stand word of its own (like `FIRE.smoke.on`, a
  picture-only key under the held `FIRE.on`: the frozen stand never draws a fire). NOT IN IT: THE FIRE'S SMOKE — `common.wgsl fogSmoke`
  hides all smoke over floor nobody sees and cannot tell a fire's plume from a grenade's, so a fire in the fog has no plume (the fog's rule, not this file's);
  and the fog's OTHER pictures (`?fogfull=0`: the paint under the remembered lamps) draw nothing of the composite, so no flame there, as before. The check's
  `fog` line (the real fog raised in the rig, the squad at its start, the brazier broken: `2@1.00` that very frame); drawn once in the page, the software adapter at Low, the squad left at its start on hard (`AWAY=1 QUERY='roomclear&squad4&difficulty=hard'`).
  NEVER SEEN ON A GPU. (The fog's remembered lamp, `?fogfull=0`'s, is the authored one, where the level hung it: fogofwar.ts `litBlock`.) Not in the ray-traced reflections; the level's glowing lid under it is dimmed to
  `coals` 0.42 of its authored glow (its bounce is that much less).
  THE SMOKE is a `look` source on the coarse lattice (`FIRE.smoke`), filed every second while the solver draws and the fire is within `viewR` 18 m of the view.
  LEARNT IN THE PAGE: a source two cells wide does NOT climb whatever its heat (temp 2.6 to 30: it hung within 0.3 to 0.6 m of where it was filed, an invisible haze
  at head height that cut a line along the wind at 1.6 m to 0.26); one five cells wide (radius 0.26, temp 30) climbs — so it is as wide as the drum and its FOOT is
  over a standing man's head (2.05 m; the check holds 1.9). MEASURED IN THE PAGE (`fire-page.cjs`, the pass, the software adapter at Low, the yard's 0.5 to 0.8 m/s of
  wind at the drum, a plume fifteen seconds old; the light each line keeps, a line starts to count smoke under 0.8): across the plume at 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7 m, over
  the drum and 0.8 and 2 m downwind, 1.00 every one; at 1.9 m 0.94 over the drum, 1.00 downwind; ALONG the wind (2 m upwind to 6 m down) 0.98 at 1.3 m, 1.00 at
  1.6 m, 0.92 at 1.9 m; overhead 0.55 at 2.6 m and 0.23 at 3.4 m (the smoke is there); with `?fire=0` every one of them 1.00. ONE wind, one level, open sky: a fire
  under a low roof or in still air may pool lower, and nobody measured that. `?firesmoke=0` (`FIRE.smoke.on`) is the fire with no smoke.
  THE SOUND: `fireBed` (a 7 s loop held as a follow voice, handed on every 12 s, asked again when a fire is lit again) and `fireCrack` with each pop — the mixer's
  alone, no event: nobody in the game hears a fire.
  WHAT IT COSTS, by the model and timed on no GPU: no light is added. The flame, coals and embers run in the composite, which every preset draws as its compute twin
  at OUTPUT size (timer row `compS`; the ladder counts it fixed, so the render scale cannot pay for it, only a preset hop): against High's 1000 rows Ultra × 1.44,
  Medium × 0.81, Low × 0.52, Very low × 0.36. Only pixels inside a fire's bound pay (a cylinder 1.3 m round it: with the game's 28° camera at 55° of pitch 5.5 % of a
  16:9 screen at the 21 m the game opens at, 14 % at 13 m, 68 % at the closest zoom, 6 m): about 2,300 operations a pixel there (ten ember tests, up to 24 more for
  1.5 s after a crack), and about 15,500 where the ray crosses the flame's marched cylinder (18 samples of six noise reads; 1.3 %, 3.3 % and 15.5 % of the screen —
  the cylinder is 1.9 mouth radii wide, the flame itself lives inside 1.1). (THE SECOND CUT MARCHES 24 SAMPLES, not 18: a third more on the flame's own pixels, none on the embers'.) Set against the resolve's row (0.25 ms at High for work of that order: a count, good to about
  three times either way) that was 0.20 ms at High at 21 m, 0.53 at 13 m and 2.5 at 6 m; since `fireFlame` returns before any read for a point the wobble cannot bring
  inside the rim, and right behind its two wobble reads for one that ends outside it (exact: the flame came out 0 there anyway, and `fire-lab.cjs`'s 24 frames are
  byte for byte the same, in still air and in wind), about 0.13, 0.35 and 1.6. The ember tests are most of the
  closest zoom's price and are as they were. THE SMOKE IS THE REAL COST and the same at every preset: the solver stays awake while a
  fire is within 18 m of the view — the plume alone holds about 1,100 bricks after twenty seconds when the solver is only
  stepped (497, 942, 1,119, 1,216 at 5, 10, 15 and 20 s, against 110 to 140 with the fire off) and the DRAWN page's pool read 2,242 fifteen seconds in against 901 with
  the fire off (the pass's own cold-weather smoke), so about 1,300 bricks: by the solver's own figures on the maintainer's Mac (0.39 µs a stepping brick, and 0.43
  ms for being awake at all on a level where nothing else smokes) 0.5 ms on the pass and about 0.95 ms where the fire is the only smoke. The plume was still
  growing slowly at twenty seconds. `?firesmoke=0` is the same fire without it, to weigh that on a GPU. BY PRESET, and the
  one rung that draws the fire without its smoke: FIRE SMOKE SHED, the next bullet.
  THE THIRD LOOK ON A GPU (2026-10-23, the maintainer playing the pass with the third cut: "this is looking better but still seems way too dark, especially
  relative to the other lights in the scene"; "i'd also expect the color from the fire to be more warm"; "would also expect the fire to be affected by the wind,
  looks like only the smoke is affected? fire sound can also be more prominent and crackly"; "shadows cast by the fire should be more dynamic i think. the fire as
  an emitter should be shifting continuously over time"; "fire getting put out by a grenade is weird"). WHAT WAS FOUND, and it explains every GPU look of the
  flame so far (pale blob, static, dim and see-through): THE TEMPORAL RESOLVE AVERAGED IT. `taau.wgsl` blends this frame in at a tenth, and its anti-flicker
  term quarters that where a neighbourhood is all contrast, which a flame on dark ground is: some forty frames of forty different flames. Particles, rain and
  smoke had reactive inputs; the composite's flame had none. Now the composite writes `1 − fireReact` into the HDR target's alpha (it was a constant 1 nobody
  read; `fireReact` = the opacity of the flame and its drawn smoke, `fire.wgsl fireVeil`, not its bed of coals, × `FIRE.look.react`), `gbaa.wgsl` carries that alpha through its rewrite, the fog of war, the outlines and the
  particle splat already kept it, and the resolve takes `react` from it like any other reactive pixel. The software adapter's stills were one frame at a time
  and never showed any of this. `?firereact=0` = averaged, as it was. THE LAMP (`FIRE.lift` 0.5, `.reach` 1.4, `.warm` [1, 0.72, 0.51], `.bright` 1.25;
  `?firebright=0` = 0.25, 1, no tint, 1): the level's lamp is 9 where a room's bulb is 26 and the gate's flood 70, and it hung a hand over the lid, where the
  drum's rim shadowed the ground a metre and a half round it (the dark ring in his shot, which ate most of the fire's pool). MORE STRENGTH IS NOT THE ANSWER:
  the tone curve pales a bright orange on snow to cream (lit snow a metre off is 0.95, 0.88, 0.77 at strength 9), so strength reads as whiter, not warmer, and
  a flame cannot look bright over ground brighter than itself. Tried at × 3 in the real page (software adapter): the yard washed out and the flame went pale
  against it. So the lamp is lifted into the flame, tinted deeper, carries 1.4 times as far (6.5 m to 9.1 m on the pass) and is only a quarter stronger, and
  the brightness is the FLAME's: `look.gain` 2 (was 1), `look.core` 1.4 (was 1), chosen on `fire-lab.cjs`'s stage from the play camera on snow (`LAMPK`,
  `LAMPC`, `LAMP` are that tool's words for the lamp). THE GAME READS THE LAMP: the check's `lamp` line reads the light meter three metres off at 0.544 by
  the level's lamp and 0.884 by a fire's at × 2 (the line's own number, not the page's), and the steady readers are told the lamp as it is; the fog of war's
  remembered picture packs a burning fire's lamp at that same steady strength (`fogofwar.ts`, one expression: its colour and reach were the live lamp's already).
  THE LAMP SHIFTS (`FIRE.wander` 0.14, `.wanderUp` 0.10,
  were 0.06 and 0.04; `?firesway=0`): how far a shadow's edge moves; whether the shadow history averages that motion away is the direct light's question,
  not looked at. THE WIND LEANS THE FLAME (`FIRE.look.lean` 0.2, was a constant 0.07 in the shader; `?firelean=0` = 0.07): `fireBend` = lean · y^1.5
  through the flame's body (y in flame heights, to 1.5) and on at two fifths of that slope above it, for the flame, its smoke off the tips and the shimmer, so
  the flame lies over some 45° in the pass's storm (the wind handed on is capped at `windMax` 3 m/s) and the marched bound grows to about 2.1 m round the
  drum from 1.6 (a straight y^1.5 at this lean made it 3 m and more). With `?firelean=0` the smoke over y 1.5 leans a little less than it did (the same
  curve at the old number): the picture only. `FIRE_STEPS` 40, was 32. SOUND: `bed` 0.85
  (was 0.5), `crack` 0.9 (was 0.55), `popRate` 1.1 a second (was 0.55): the fire's own levels, no change to the sound table or the mixer; more cracks is also
  more flashes of the lamp and more throws of embers. A FIRE IS NOT PUT OUT BY A ROUND OR A BLAST (`FIRE.hardy`, `?firehardy=0`): `combat.ts`'s fixture rule
  and `destruction.ts`'s (`fixtureLive`, the blast's fixture loop, `fixtureRound`) take a fire that `fireHolds` for no fixture at all, so a lamp behind one can
  still be shot, and call `fireStir` where the hit lands (a crack at rate 0.7 and a throw of embers on the fire's next frame from the host's book, one in
  `stirGap` 0.3 s however long the burst); nothing is counted against the encounter's fixtures or `AIMCOST_STATS.lampHits`, no light event goes to the
  guards. Its own box blown away (`breakFixtureBox`) still takes it, and so does a level's own switch or script. Driven through the real `bang` beside the
  pass's brazier on the shipped stand: out with the rule off, burning and stirred once with it on.
  THIS REMOVES A WAY TO MAKE DARK: a brazier cannot be shot out any more, which is the maintainer's to weigh for the quiet missions. A recording from before any
  of these keys replays with the level's lamp, no reactive flame, the 0.07 lean and a fire a round puts out (`journal.ts`). The lab (`/firelab`) has a slider for
  each: how fresh each frame of the flame is, how far the wind leans it, how orange / strong / far-carrying / high the light is, how far it shifts, and a
  section for the sound. NOT MEASURED: tallies on the shipped stand with the brighter lamp (guards by a fire are better lit and see further into its pool);
  no soak or tour run. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU: the reactive flame (the whole point of it), the lamp's colour, the lean, the shifting shadows.
  THE MAINTAINER'S OWN NUMBERS (2026-10-24, from the fire lab's "copy them" line on his GPU, taken as sent and made the table's defaults): `look` gain 3, core 4
  (both the top of their sliders, which now go to 8 and 10), sigma 2.5 (a thin veil where it was 12), speed 0.7, tall 0.95, torn 1.1, shimmer 0.019, soot 0.5;
  `height` 1.15 (was 0.75: the smoke's foot, the gas's and the embers' heights go up with it), `coals` 0.26 (the lid's glow, which the GPU meter reads through
  the bounce), `depth` 0.4 and `kick` 0.6, 60 embers of 1.7 s and 4 mm, and the drifting smoke at density 1, heat 21, speed 0.9 (thinner and slower than the
  2.2, 30, 1.5 whose sight lines are measured above: less of it, nothing measured again). THE GAME READS depth and kick: with the level's lamp (the check's
  `meter` line, frozen stand, one seed, twenty seconds) the light estimate 1.25 m off swings 1.785 to 4.701 about a steady 3.350 (mean 7.1 % under) and 3 m
  off 0.338 to 0.806 about 0.533 (0.6 % under), where the figures quoted further up were for depth 0.3 and kick 0.25; the lamp's own long-run mean is about a
  twentieth over the authored (the kick's share at 1.1 cracks a second), so the check's two mean bars are a tenth now, were a twentieth. HE SET THESE ON THE
  BUILD BEFORE the rules of the paragraph above, so the picture with them is not the one he tuned: the nearest to that is
  `?firereact=0&firelean=0&firebright=0&firesway=0` (twice the cracks and `FIRE_STEPS` 40 have no word). TWO MENDS FOR HIS NUMBERS: the reactive mark is
  `min(1, 4 × fireVeil)`, since at sigma 2.5 ten centimetres of flame is only a fifth opaque and its tongues would have gone back to the history; and the
  lamp's shift up and down is held to `wanderUp` (the kick is past the swing, and at 0.6 over 0.4 it snapped the lamp 15 cm in a frame with each crack).
  NOT his: `wander` (he sent 0.07; his note asking for shadows that move came with it, so it stays 0.14). COST, not timed: at sigma 2.5 next to no ray goes
  opaque, so nearly every flame pixel runs all 40 samples, over a bound a sixth taller. `fire-lab.cjs`'s look, height, kick, swing and lid glow follow.
  NOT SEEN by anyone with `react`, the lifted lamp and the lean together.
  FOUR MENDS FROM A REVIEWER'S READ OF THE CODE (2026-10-24; a fifth read, that the lamp's newer rows ride `FIRE.on` on the frozen stand with no row of their
  own, is true and as meant: no frozen digest or fixture is recorded with `TPS_FIRE=1`, and the check pins them itself). (1) A FIRE PUT OUT WHERE NOBODY SEES is
  remembered in the fog as a fire's light: `fire.ts held` keeps its tint and reach and its steady strength while the fog holds its ghost, and `fogofwar.ts`
  takes the ghost's strength from that steady record (it was the level's, a fifth dimmer, paler and shorter, at the lid). It is held from the very frame it
  goes out, one frame ahead of the fog's say. ONLY under the fog's full picture with `FIRE.fog` on: with `?fogfull=0` or `?firefog=0` the fog remembers the
  level's lamp, as before. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU. (2) `fireStir`'s gap is each fire's own: a grenade between two braziers stirs both. (3) The player's round stirs a fire on the older lamp
  search too (`AIMCOST.lamp` off, or a show on the stage), and that search goes on past the fire to a lamp behind it. (4) A floor with no fire tells the solver
  to let hot gas go (`keepHot(0)`); the page stands one game on a fresh solver a level, so nothing reaches this today. The check's fog, hardy and gas
  lines hold each; (3) stirs on a round that STOPPED in the drum, the newer search's own rule. RUN SINCE, and it found the rule itself short: a fire's own box is its glowing lid, a finger thick, and the drum is four boxes of the level's that name no fire, so a round into the drum stirred nothing on any path (the line of October 23 called `fireStir` itself and never fired a round). `fire.ts fireStruck` now says a round stopped in a fire when it stopped in the fire's box OR in a box that stands on the fire's axis under its mouth, within the drum's wall (1.7 lids, 0.3 m at least; a wall behind the drum or the ground beside it is no drum); the player's two lamp searches and `destruction.ts fixtureRound` (everyone else's rounds) ask it. `fire-check`'s hardy line fires a real round into the drum from three metres by each search: one stir each, still burning.
  CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts fire` (`tools/qa/fire-check.ts`, families `render`, `all`; twenty-three lines, both stands; `FIRE_BREAK=1` fails twenty-one): the lamp's swing
  and place, a second game the same frame for frame, the bed and the cracks, out and lit again, a checkpoint load (and the bed asked for again behind it; kept through frames that move no clock; asked for again behind a restart), the smoke's sources (look-only, coarse, foot over
  heads; none without a solver, on a preset that sheds it, or with the smoke put off; the game that smoked for twelve seconds and the one nothing drew differ in
  nothing of the fire's state), the steady readers, the lamp's size (0.24 m burning, the steady readers told the level's 0.06 and reading the same to the bit a hand from the lamp; the level's
  size with `size` 0, with the switch off and in a recording without the key), the CPU estimate (1.25 m off: steady 3.350, burning 2.02 to 4.24, mean −9.3 %; 3 m: 0.533 against 0.35 to 0.71,
  mean −3.1 %; with `lift` 0.3 the near one read −11.9 % and the line was red, which is why the lamp stands at 0.25), off = the build as it was, an old recording. THE SHADER ALONE: `node tools/qa/fire-lab.cjs` (seconds; where the look was set). THE REAL PAGE:
  `node tools/qa/fire-page.cjs` (software adapter, minutes; EVERY FIGURE AND STILL FROM HERE TO "NOT DONE" IS THE FIRST CUT'S, lamp 6 cm and `lift` 0.2: of the
  second cut the page was drawn at High from the still's own view, `QUALITY=high VIEWS=shot W=640 H=350`, 119 of 119 pipelines, two stills: a red and orange flame
  with a yellow root standing clear of the snow, the drum's shadow a soft dark foot round it — on the octagon drum, before ROUND joined): it boots with the switch either way (119 of 119 pipelines, no page error) and
  the stills are on the fire's page (rebuild/fire/): a flame on a bed of coals with the man beside it, the wall and the snow lit warm, a pale plume leaning downwind — against
  a white lid. THE GPU METER there, the same sixteen frames of the same game with the fire and without (the player's `visibility`): at 1.25 m 0.941 to 0.949
  burning against 0.952 to 0.955 steady; 3 m 0.635 to 0.717 against 0.605 to 0.631; 5 m 0.375 to 0.674 against 0.398 to 0.608 (the storm's lightning is in both). Half
  a second a stand: enough to say the flicker moves the meter by hundredths, not to give its swing.
  SEEN ON A GPU, ONCE (2026-10-23, the maintainer's Mac at High on the pass, one still; his words: "fire looks a bit jank tbh"). What the still showed, none of
  which the software adapter at Low had: (1) THE FLAME WAS A PALE SOFT BLOB with no tongues and no red. It was thin (`FIRE_SIGMA` 8) and ADDED to snow its own lamp
  lights as bright as it is, and its heart was radiance 5: the tone curve (AgX at exposure 2) turns a red above about 1 and a yellow above about 2.5 to cream, so
  brighter only read as paler. (2) A HARD BLACK DISC A METRE ROUND THE DRUM: the drum's own shadow from a lamp 6 cm in radius 36 cm over its rim. (3) THE COALS
  READ GREY: their gaps were radiance 3 and up, cream by the same curve. THE SECOND CUT (the same day) is the numbers above: the flame hides what is behind it and its
  colours stay under the curve's shoulder, the lamp is the flame's size and a little higher, the coals' gaps are 1.15 × a deep orange. It was set in `fire-lab.cjs`
  from his camera (`DIST=7 PITCH=50 ALB=0.85`: snow; the stage's lamp now casts the soft shadow, `LAMP` and `SIZE`) and
  `fire-page.cjs` has his view (`VIEWS=shot`, `DPR=2`). THE SECOND CUT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN ON A GPU.
  NOT DONE, KNOWN: the flame's clock wraps
  every 68 minutes (one frame's jump in its shape); `brazier*` is a name rule, not a level key; a brazier can still be shot out or jammed and the flame dies with
  its lamp. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU OR HEARD: the flame in motion through the temporal resolve (its 18-step dither, one-pixel embers under the clip), the flicker's
  feel on the yard, the plume, the sound, and every cost above.
- **The floor rung draws an open fire without its smoke (FIRE SMOKE SHED: `settings.fireSmokeShed`, `ui/quality.ts fireSmokeOf`; 2026-10-23).** Asked when the fire
  was merged: price it by preset, and say whether a preset should drop its smoke. The maintainer's rule stands (the smoke stays near High and other things pay the frame
  budget first), so this is the one rung with nothing left to pay. THE PRICE, by the cost model and timed on no GPU: the fire's smoke is the solver's fixed 0.5 ms (other
  smoke already keeps the solver awake, as the men's breath does on the pass) to 0.95 ms (the fire is the only smoke) at EVERY preset — 1,300 bricks at 0.39 µs a
  stepping brick, + 0.43 ms awake; every preset solves with high's four pairs since ONE SMOKE SOLVE, which is what that figure was measured at. Against each rung's
  modelled compute at its own scale on the maintainer's Mac, and what the ladder's render scale gives up on a machine that only just holds the rung at its 15 ms:
  ultra 31.3 ms, 2 to 3 %, 1 to 2 % of its rows; high 14.5, 3.5 to 6.5 %, 3 to 5 %; medium 8.7, 6 to 11 %, 5 to 10 %; low 4.6, 11 to 20 %, 12 to 24 % (past the
  0.5 scale floor where the fire is the only smoke: that machine hops to verylow beside a fire); verylow 2.9, 17 to 32 %, and it cannot be paid — its whole per-pixel
  part is 1.0 model-ms on the scale floor, 15 ms becomes 17.6 to 19.8. The flame's own price is the bullet above. THE RULE: a preset with `smokeOwn` (verylow: the rung that
  already keeps its own cheap smoke under SMOKE KEEP, for the same reason) draws the fire with its flame, embers, light and sound and files no smoke source; every
  rung above keeps the smoke and the scale pays. UP FROM THE FLOOR THE SHED STANDS ONE RUNG (`fireSmokeFor`): auto prices the hop verylow → low off a frame measured
  with no fire smoke, so a low that put the smoke back would be 0.5 to 0.95 ms short beside a fire, fall to the floor, find room and hop again, the plume coming and
  going each time. While AUTO moves the preset, low reached from verylow keeps the shed; the smoke is back at medium (where the scale has the room: the hop low →
  medium is priced without it too, and medium's scale has 6 to 11 % to give) or when a preset is put on by hand; a machine that came DOWN to low keeps its smoke. HOW: `Quality.apply` writes `settings.fireSmoke` (render-side, never `FIRE.smoke.on`: that table rides the journal
  and a graphics preset must not write it), `game/fire.ts updateFire` reads it beside the solver's `drawing`; a fire that gets its smoke back (a hop up the ladder)
  smokes the same frame, and one that loses it just stops filing: the plume there thins out by itself and the solver sleeps when its bricks are let go. SWITCH:
  `settings.fireSmokeShed`, default on, `?fireshed=0` = every preset keeps the fire's smoke, as it was (render-side like ONE SMOKE SOLVE: no `FROZEN_HOLDS` row, no
  journal line; `?firesmoke=0` still puts the smoke off at every preset). WHAT IT IS NOT: a game rule on any stand (the source is look-only, and no headless stand
  has a solver that draws) — but in the PAGE a sight line reads the solver, so beside a fire a line over a standing man's head (the fire's notes: 0.92 to 0.94 kept
  at 1.9 m, 0.55 at 2.6 m, all of it at 1.7 m and under) reads the plume on low and up and none on verylow. Nobody in the game looks along such a line today.
  ALSO RENDER-SIDE BY WAIVER, to be confirmed: the key is read inside the game's update (beside `drawing`, itself a render setting). What it
  decides is kept out of the game's state: the fire's book of which smoke it filed and which bed voices it asked for is on the HOST, beside the list the
  renderer is handed (`engine.hostBooks.fire`, `fire.ts FireShown`; `host/api.ts HostBooks` is the one bag for such books, dropped whole by the put-back's one line, so a book kept there cannot be forgotten; `Game.engine` is in no snapshot), and `fire.states` holds only what the clock alone decides — so a
  preset or a solver moves no state hash through the fire (the fire check's line 'the host's, not the game's': the game that smoked for twelve seconds and the
  one nothing drew differ in no row of the fire's, and the lamp and the coals are the same to the bit). WHO ABANDONS THE MOMENT DROPS THE BOOK: a restart, and
  with it a file's or a checkpoint's load (`game.ts restartEncounter`, beside the line that empties the solver), and a save in memory put back
  (`host/putback.ts`); a fresh one is begun on the next frame that moves the clock, the smoke is filed and the bed asked for on that frame, and the abandoned
  moment's voice lets go — where before a load into an earlier twelve seconds left a burning fire silent until the next mark (the check's second load line,
  which runs the host's own `hostAfterPutBack`, `FIREBOOK_BREAK=1` undoes the put-back's line and fails it; and its 'restart' line: the clock does not move
  with a restart, a source and a bed on the next frame, once). A FRAME THAT MOVES NO CLOCK IS NOT A LOAD: the page updates the game with `dt` 0 for the kit
  page's still and a card's frozen still (a pause skips the update), and the first cut of this rule took every such frame for a load — the bed's voice was let
  go and asked for again and a source filed on the next frame (found by a review; the check's 'still' line and the preset line's last count were red on it).
  A second cut read the clock instead (a book is another moment's when the clock is not where it left it) and lost the restart, which does not move the
  clock: found by the next review before it left the branch. The book is kept by a fire's place among the level's, a frame stamp each, with no limit on how
  many. NOT KNOWN TO IT: whether the mixer still holds the bed (a page frozen past the mixer's own hold, `audio.ts FOLLOW_SECS`, resumes with no bed until
  the next twelve-second mark). A page replay under another preset
  still files other look sources (the men's breath kept its own word for the solver in the game's state until the step after: its book is the host's too now, `engine.hostBooks.breath`, `weather.md`). NOT DONE: the
  other look sources (the men's breath, the cigarette) still wake the solver on verylow, so on a level with them the shed saves the plume's bricks (0.5 ms) and not
  the 0.43 ms of being awake; `settings.fireSmoke` is written when a preset is put on, so the switch moved by hand on a running page waits for the next preset.
  CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ladder` (four lines: by hand, under auto up from the floor, the switch off, a bare mock; `FIRESHED_BREAK=1` fails two) and
  `probes.ts fire`'s line 'on the graphics preset that sheds it', the real `Quality` over the game's own settings (verylow put on: no source in four seconds; low put
  on: a source that frame; both stands; `FIRESHED_BREAK=1` fails it). THE REAL PAGE (the software adapter, the pass, 640 × 360, the player beside the brazier, the camera at 13 m; a
  frame is twenty seconds and more there, so this is half a second of the game): verylow pinned, on this text, boots 119 of 119 pipelines with no page error, `fireSmoke`
  false, the flame drawn over the drum (the shader's two early returns compiled into the composite), and in sixteen frames no source filed and no brick in the solver's
  pool; low put on in that page: a source that same frame, 64 bricks, then 151 fifteen frames on. With `?fireshed=0` (a page from before the auto rule and the
  shader's first bound were written; stopped early, so its error list was never read): verylow boots 119 of 119, `fireSmoke` true, a source filed within the first
  eight frames, 125 bricks. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU, and nobody has watched the ladder move beside a fire: the auto rule is the self-test's alone. A take that would settle the prices: the pass and mission 1's level by the fire, F8 at high and low, the page / `?firesmoke=0` / `?fire=0`, at the zoom the
  game opens at and at the closest; and a fire under a roof, where the plume pools (never measured).
- **SURFACES, A TRY (`?surf` at boot; `render/frame.ts surfTryConfig`, OFF; the scene prelude's const `SURF_TRY`, `shaders/surface.wgsl`, read in `gbuffer.wgsl fsBox`
  after the detail layer and before the wet ground and the markings):** an answer to "what would textures and normal maps buy on today's boxes", NOT the look
  (`STYLE.md` rule 1 stands until the maintainer says otherwise; the picking of it is theirs). With the word, a box's PAINT is classed against `GWOT_PALETTE`
  (`gbuffer.ts surfaceWgsl` writes `surfClass`: an exact test per palette paint, then a darkened-paint test for the classed ones; eight classes: mud wall, plaster, block,
  earth, gravel, slab, wood, sheet) and the class's written pattern changes the pixel's albedo, normal and roughness in the g-buffer: no image, no binding, no
  level data. Capped faces, glowing boxes, turned boxes and paints of no class are as they were. THE RELIEF IS HELD UNDER `SURF_TILT` 0.18 so the shading normal stays
  inside `bounceLeftNoWall`'s 0.98 (a normal further off an axis asks the walled bounce read); detail finer than the pixel's footprint is faded out. WHAT SEES IT:
  the g-buffer's readers only (direct, the filters' edge stops, composite). Rays, the light cache, reflection hits, the cards and the LIGHT METER read the box's
  flat paint as ever, so nothing a man senses moves. Without the word the const is false and the branch is dead code, but it is still TEXT: the prelude gains the one const
  line and the two g-buffer modules carry `surface.wgsl` and the generated `surfClass` (about 16 KB each) on every page. `surf` rides a replay page's address
  (`ui/replaykey.ts VISIT_FLAGS`). KNOWN WRONG, left so because it is a try: THE CLASS IS A GUESS FROM THE COLOUR, so a paint outside the GWOT palette that is
  a darker shade of a classed one takes its class (on the office: lino, stone and concrete draw as block, cartons as mud wall; try it on the GWOT levels), and
  rain-darkened earth keeps or changes class while wet gravel and slab go plain; the pattern is laid in WORLD space for six of the eight classes, so it stays
  put while a pushed prop slides under it; the footprint is the across-the-ray pixel size, too fine on a wall seen at a low angle (expect crawl there); relief past
  `SURF_TILT` is clipped to a facet (the ribs of sheet metal most of all); a box yawed a few degrees can still lean past 0.98. A cut box's own faces keep the
  pattern, its cut faces are bare. No check holds any of this. SEEN: on the software adapter only (the compound, squad of four, very low, 800×500, one seed,
  night and midday, 118 of 118 pipelines, no GPU or console error, the same two views with and without the word). Never seen on a GPU: the look at the play
  resolution, motion, shimmer under the temporal blend, the noise it adds to bounce light, and the cost (it is raster work, which no trusted timer covers).
- **THE LOOK PROTOTYPE** (`?look` at boot, or the page `/look` = the game's page with `look` on the pass at night unless the link names its own `levelFile`; `?look=relief:1.4,air:2` opens it with those
  amounts, each held to 0‥4, and `?look=plain|0|off` stays the GWOT dress's word and does not raise it; `render/frame.ts lookConfig`,
  `shaders/look.wgsl`, `render/lookTex.ts`, the panel `ui/lookpanel.ts`; OFF on every other page). A place to find out how far materials carry a world of boxes,
  NOT the look (`STYLE.md` rule 1 stands until the maintainer says otherwise). Where the surfaces try above writes a pattern in the shader, this one samples MAPS:
  eleven tiling materials (the try's eight classes and three more for what stood untouched beside them: cloth, bare metal and painted metal; the class is
  `lookClass`, the try's table with those rows added, `gbuffer.ts LOOK_OF`) made on the CPU at boot, 512 × 512 over 2 m, as two mipped `rgba8unorm` texture
  arrays (A = paint multiplier ÷ 2 + height, B = tangent normal + roughness + cavity; no image file ships). They sit at the g-buffer object group's bindings
  11 to 14 with a repeating, anisotropic sampler and a 96-byte uniform block, ALL FOUR ONLY ON THAT PAGE: without the word the g-buffer modules get a stub of a few lines and the bind group is the page's as it was. What stays on every page: the prelude's `LOOK` / `LOOK_BOUNCE` consts, `lookGeoN` in `common.wgsl`, and one
  flat `u32` varying on the box vertex output (zero). FOUR LAYERS, each a slider on the panel (`gbuffer.ts lookAmounts`, 0 = that layer off, all 0 = the boxes
  as the game draws them, by an early return: none of the reads run): the maps (paint, relief, finish, cavity); the repeat broken for the four materials without courses (a second read, turned and
  shifted, cross-faded by a slow noise and by height); weather that follows the BUILDING (a wall's foot damp to a ragged line with its tide mark, its head
  bleached with runs under it, slow blotches, and on the ground the level's traffic map: walked earth pale and flat, stones against the walls); and small
  boxes' edges rounded in the normal and rubbed pale. THE NORMAL: `fsBox` stores the tilted normal with the normal target's alpha 0 (a code no other writer
  uses for a surface EXCEPT ON A SNOW LEVEL, where the alpha is the snow's mark in four steps: 1 plain, 2/3 thin snow, 1/3 snow, and 0 was only the clear.
  There the tilt takes 0 where no snow lies, a snow pixel keeps the snow's normal and its mark, and on the look page `composite.wgsl snowGlowAmt` reads an alpha
  under 0.17 as no snow. Every read and write of that alpha the prototype adds is a line of its own tagged THE LOOK PROTOTYPE in its comment, and
  `snowglow-check` and `snowsparkle-check`, which hold the mark's writers and readers by their text, drop tagged lines before they read). `gdown` hands the working-size targets the box's own
  FACE (`lookGeoN`: the box axis the normal leans on most, exact while the tilt is under `LOOK_MAX_TILT` 0.48; a mark laid over the relief, `decals.wgsl`, is laid on the face and the two are held under the cap together; a tilt under 0.02 is stored as the face, unmarked), so the reservoirs, the filters, the gather,
  the reflections and `bounceLeftNoWall` read the flat wall they always read. Three readers see the relief: `sharp_direct.wgsl` scores each light that reaches the cell a second
  time on the tilted normal and re-weighs each class's result by that ratio over the live lights' sum (capped at 4; a light the face itself turns from gives
  nothing), `composite.wgsl` leans the bounced light by how far the facet looks up (`LOOK_BOUNCE` 0.7), and the fog of war's picture (`fogofwar.wgsl`, which
  has no id to find the face by) shades what it remembers with it (the cap keeps a wall's facet under its `N.y > 0.5` test for a top). IT NEEDS SHARP DIRECT (every preset has it): with `?nosharp`
  the working-size passes read the tilted normals themselves. Rays, the light cache, reflection hits and the LIGHT METER read the flat paint as ever, so
  nothing a man senses moves. KNOWN WRONG, left so because it is a prototype: the class is still a guess from the colour (the try's list above); the maps are
  laid in world space for six of eleven classes, so a pushed prop slides under them; relief past the tilt cap is clipped; the bounce's lean assumes its light
  comes from above, and on the ground a facet can only lose bounce, never gain it; a facet lit by a light that only grazes the face gets at most four times
  that light, and a light that reaches the cell but is shadowed at the pixel still has its say in which way the relief reads; the edges rule is by size (a box
  under 1.3 m on its long side and 1.6 m tall), so two small boxes laid edge to edge show a groove; the maps cost about 5 s of the boot and 31 MB of texture. No check holds any of this.
  ON A SNOW LEVEL (the second round, made for the pass; the panel's 'Snow that clings', 0 = none of it): `look.wgsl lookSnow`, called from `fsBox` for the
  level file's own boxes, reads the snow field's cover. A TOP left out under the sky (a crate, a stack of planks, a sill, a gatepost) takes a cap of the
  ground's own snow with a ragged, domed edge. A FACE that stands on open ground takes a bank against its foot, higher on the side the wind blows at,
  with the snow's normal and mark; above the bank a thin rime and round clots that fade a stride up, which are paint and finish only. Never on bare metal
  (stoves, flues and braziers are warm), on a lit, turned or glass box, or on a box painted as snow or as a path (a marking on a face is covered like the face). BARE EARTH AND GRAVEL within 0.3 m of lying snow are
  frozen: frost grains, and dark ice in the low places, smooth enough to show a lamp. LYING SNOW (`look.wgsl lookGround`, one tagged line in `fsBox` and one in `snow.wgsl fsSnow`, after `snowShade`): its whole relief (the drifts' slopes,
  the wind's ridges, the prints and their rims) × the panel's 'Snow relief' (1 = as the build draws it; the page opens at 1.5), and 'Snow crust': fresh snow
  the wind has glazed, in streaks drawn out along it, takes roughness 0.56, which is over every preset's `rt.maxRough` so no glaze asks for a reflection ray.
  The steeper normals are the snow's own, marked as snow: the working-size passes read them as they read the build's (the tilt is not handed back as a
  face), so more relief is also more for the filters to hold still. AIR (the panel's row, `lookConfig.air`; 1 = the level's own haze, 0 = none) is × `settings.hazeDensity`
  in the frame block and in the beams' air line. Known wrong here: a cut piece (`gbuffer_cut.wgsl`) takes no clinging snow, so a wall loses its bank where
  a blast cut it; the frost reads the field, which knows no roof, so an earth floor inside an outer wall takes a hand's width of it along the wall; the
  bank and the caps are paint: no ray, bounce or meter knows them, as with the snow's own hills.
  SEEN: on the software adapter only (round one: the compound at midday; round two: the pass at night; squad of four, very low, one seed, 119 of 119 pipelines, no GPU or console error). Never seen on
  a GPU: the look at the play resolution, motion, shimmer, and the cost (anisotropic array reads are raster work, which no trusted timer covers; read the
  page's fps with the panel's "stay plain" box on and off: that measures everything but the class test a corner and the wider bind group).
- **A GEOMETRY TRIAL** (`src/scene/geoTry.ts`; on only on the look page, `?look`, with cut boxes on; `?geo=0` or the look panel's Shapes button
  leaves it out; no switch table and no state of its own: `main.ts geoTryOn` reads the link). Asked 2026-10-23: "how viable other modeling systems
  (low poly triangles, analytic surfaces, SDFs) are for geometry", then the trial picked from a card. The answer tried is the CUT BOX
  (`scene/cut.ts`), because the raster, every GPU ray and every CPU ray already meet it as one solid: nothing new to keep in step. It runs once,
  after the level file loads and before its boxes go to the world (`bootLevel`), and sets `cutConfig.swap` false at boot (its cut boxes stand for
  the whole visit, so the one set of ray programs with the cut rule is compiled from the start).
  ROUND THINGS (`roundStacks`): the kit's octagon (`gwotKit.ts round`: four slabs 45° apart) becomes ONE regular twelve-sided prism, the box's four
  faces + eight planes (the record's whole room), with `Box.cutRound = 2` (packed in the core row's w as 1024 × (1 + the axis); never with glass. Until the merge of 10-25 it was 128 ×: the build's ROUND THINGS, `scene/round.ts`, took 128 as their own bit, a cylinder about the box's y that every ray meets; `gbuffer_cut.wgsl cutRoundAxis` reads both and shades both with the one block, so on the look page a level's drum is the build's round thing and the trial's prisms are the lorry's wheels and the logs).
  The other three slabs stay in the list, hidden (`NoPrimary | NoShadow`, shrunk): a level file's box indices are names. In `gbuffer_cut.wgsl
  fsBoxCut` a round's side faces are one face: the normal turns with the point, marks run round it (the long face's band is put on all four sides;
  a lid's one-paint patch is drawn again as a disc; a drum's two-paint lid is let go and the shader draws a rolled rim). The look's paint and its clinging snow
  are rules that run along a flat face, so each is asked a quarter of the round at a time (the box face the normal leans to) and what it leans the
  normal by is added back onto the round; such a pixel is never marked as a tilted normal (`common.wgsl lookGeoN` would snap it to a box axis). The
  silhouette, the shadow and every ray keep the twelve flat faces. The snow hook knows a round about y only. On the pass: 19 octagons (drums, tyres, two stoves, the oven), so 57 fewer boxes for a ray to meet.
  A BROKEN WALL TOP (`breakWallTops`): a yard wall (a plain upright box, 3.4 m or longer, with a coping slab of its own length on it) gets one bite
  where nothing tall stands against it and no lamp hangs: the wall and coping are split at the bite and five cut boxes with slanted tops, each a step off its
  neighbour, fill it; the level's snow caps on the coping are cut back to both sides of it; five picture-only lumps lie at the foot. The pieces are `Box.cutOld`
  (512 in the core row's w): on the look page their cut faces take the look's paint as a face of the core's stuff, and the snow lies on the ones
  that look up. A blast's fresh cut never sets it. A bite's middle stops at 2.0 m and its lowest edge at 1.98 m: no standing eye gains a line, and the
  wall still stands over the 2 m line a sound is carried across (`collision.ts`). On the pass: two bites, both in the
  road wall. New boxes are APPENDED (nothing is removed), so `levelFileOf(level).boxes` is shorter than `level.boxes` on that page.
  Known wrong: what pushes against a box meets the UNCUT box, so a man slides round a drum's square, a hand's width out from the round at its four
  corners (the octagon was nearer); the bank of clinging snow steps at the four quarter lines of a round; the authored snow caps on a drum and a
  tyre stack are still the kit's squares; a blast next to a round cannot cut it further (its record is full), and a wall charge on a piece of the bite
  rebuilds it with a square top (`wallcharge.ts` does not read `cut`); the lumps cast no shadow. The trial changes what a ray and a body meet with no
  knob and no journal key: only the level's fingerprint tells a save or a recording made with it from one made without (each is refused on the other).
- **GROUND THAT RAYS CAN SEE, A TRIAL** (`src/scene/groundField.ts`; asked 10-23 after the geometry trial: "do both that and rays on the ground"). On
  THE LOOK PROTOTYPE's page only (`?hills=0`, or the look panel's Ground button, puts it off; the page loads again). The snow hills were PICTURE ONLY: a ray
  met the level's snow boxes under them, never the hill. Here the hills' height, as their mesh draws it (`snowField.ts` `mound`, 10 texels a metre, a texel
  with nothing on it a finger under the ground as the mesh's corners are), rides in `boxMat`'s LAST rows (after the cut table: no new binding, 452 KB),
  with a head row and the highest hill of each 1 m plan cell in front. `common.wgsl ghHit` marches the stretch of a ray that runs between the ground and
  the highest hill, 0.1 m a step and 40 steps at most (a longer stretch in longer steps), one row a step over a cell with no hill, and answers the last
  place the ray stood above the surface (four halvings), so what is shaded or traced on from a hit starts outside the hill. A ray that STARTS under the
  surface meets nothing: the hills are a skin seen from above. It is asked by `occluded` (after the boxes leave the ray clear), `occludedT` and the
  direct light's soft-character path (the hill is the cap a nearer box still beats) and both closest-hit walks (the hit is the ground slab's, its normal
  the hill's slope; `fgather.wgsl giPointOnBox` lets such a sample keep its history). `occludedTBoxes` itself is untouched, so the fog of war's sight
  and the walled cache read are as they were. Every pass that traces light takes it: the direct light's shadows, the gather, the cascades, reflections,
  the volumes, the particles AND THE LIGHT METER (`probe.wgsl`): on that page a man behind a bank is darker to the meter than the headless stand-in
  says. The game hands the rows over where it hands the field to the g-buffer (`game.ts syncSnowLook`), and whole again after a blast digs a hill
  (`stepSnowTracks`).
  Switch: the prelude's `const GROUND_RAYS` from `groundRayConfig.on`, raised by `main.ts` at boot; off = the reads are dead code and the buffer no longer
  (the prelude gains one line of text on every page, the same on each). Not a rule of the game: no knob table, no journal key, no check of its own.
  THE OPEN GROUND ROLLS (`?roll=<m>`, 0 to 0.25, off unless asked; `buildSnowField`'s `roll`): the lying snow under the open sky is baked with a slow
  swell that deep at most, thinner where it is trodden or old (a path reads as a trench through it), none on cleared ground, under a roof or in a wall.
  The mesh then covers the whole yard (88 k quads on the pass at 0.14, 40 k without) and the rays meet it. Nothing in the update reads it: a man's feet
  stand on the level's flat ground, up to the swell's depth under the picture's snow.
  Not in it: the hills' fine relief (the swell, the wind's ridges) and the boot prints, which stay a matter of the shading normal; a hill's own pixels
  start their rays a finger and a half off the mesh and `GH_BIAS` (8 mm) is all that keeps the mesh's triangles and the march's four-texel blend apart.
- **THE LOOK PANEL'S SUN AND MOON ROWS** (`src/ui/lookpanel.ts`; the maintainer, 10-23: "do we model a sun at all for dawn/midday? i think that's a big
  reason why it looks flat. and perhaps we should also model a moon on night levels (and can configure it)"). Both were there: every hour but night
  puts in a sun (`game/hours.ts`, a kind-2 light with traced shadows where the level's moon stood), and every level is authored with a moon. What made
  his picture flat: the pass is a snow level, and the snow's cloud (0.9) leaves the sun 9 % of the hour's own (`cloudLight`); the pass's moon is 0.06,
  where the level kit's own is 0.9, so his night shadows were the gate lamp's. The rows set both for the VISIT: Sun = `__hour.sun(k)` (the share of the
  hour's own sun; it then stands against the cloud, the sky still follows it), Moon / Moon height / Moon bearing = `window.__moon.set({ k, elev,
  bearing })` (`main.ts weatherHourHooks`: the level's steady directional light; `?moon=k,elev,bearing` sets it at boot). A row is greyed while its light
  is not up. THE MOON AND PLAY: the sun's strength is carried by a checkpoint and the journal (the hour's record) and the meter's CPU stand-in reads it
  (`hourLight`); the moon's is NOT carried, and `guards.ts lightEstimateAt` skips every directional light but the hour's sun, so a raised moon moves the
  picture and the GPU's meter and not the headless stand-in or the team's light rules. A moon worth playing under needs that stand-in to count it (the
  sun's one segment test is the model) and a level's own number: a rule of the game, for a switch of its own.
- **THE LOOK PANEL'S CLARITY ROW** (`render/gbuffer.ts setLook`; the maintainer on his GPU, 10-25: "it does feel a bit too "high frequency" for me, like
  edges are cranked up (e.g. "clarity" knob in lightroom)"). One number over the four layers that set a surface against its own neighbourhood: Relief,
  Cavities, Edges and Snow relief are each sent × Clarity (their rows keep their own numbers). Default 0.7; 1 = the layers as their rows say. Plain boxes
  set it to 1 with the snow's relief, and Snow relief at exactly 1 (the game's own snow, what the sweep's row flips to) is sent as 1 whatever Clarity
  says. Nobody has seen 0.7 on a GPU.
- **THE LOOK PANEL'S SKY LIGHT ROW** (`lookConfig.sky`, `engine.ts` where the frame block is written; a MEASURING row, asked for by the maintainer's
  midday note, 10-25: "we need much more ambient light coming from the sky. it shouldn't be so dark underneath the shed here"). The sky's zenith and
  horizon as the picture and its rays have them × the row (0 to 4, default 1). It is the same lever as the debugger's sky brightness, put where the look
  is judged, and it reaches the GPU only: what the game reads off the sky on the CPU (`hours.ts skyLum`, so the headless light meter) does not see it.
  Not a fix and not a default to move: MEASURED with it (the plain page, the pass at midday, snow weather, software adapter): the lorry bay's floor
  holds 3 to 12 % of the open yard's light, which is what one open side lets in (a view factor of 0.03 to 0.05 at five metres in, 0.12 at three), so the
  sky's light arrives about right. The bay read black for three other reasons: one exposure set for sunlit snow (1.7), the tone curve's toe (scene ×
  exposure 0.01 comes out at code 18, 0.05 at 59), and dirt whose paint is very dark (luminance about 0.1). Hence the next row.
- **THE LOOK PANEL'S "EYES ADJUST TO SHADE" ROW** (`lookConfig.shade`, 0.7 on the look page, 0 = off; `engine.ts lookShade` writes `frame.shadeCfg`
  @832, `composite.wgsl lookShadeGain` reads it; the maintainer, 10-25: "it shouldn't be so dark underneath the shed here", then "let's make sure the
  ambient occlusion fix is general and fits nicely with our lighting pipeline. i want it to feel quite realistic!"). No light is added. By day, the
  light a pixel SENDS BACK (its diffuse and its mirror share) is shown up to ×6 brighter where the place it is in holds less light than open air, as an
  eye opens up looking into a shed. THE PLACE is read off the radiance cache (`diceMeanRadiance`, no ray) against what open air holds from the sky
  alone, raised to the row's amount. It is the MOST of five reads (here and 0.6 of a cell to each side in plan), because a probe buried in a container
  or a thick wall holds nothing and would make the ground beside it read as a dark place: a glow round every big thing. The price is on the kinder
  side: within a cell of a bright neighbour (the inside of a shed's outer wall, a doorway) less is brought up, which reads as the shade a wall's foot
  has anyway; a room under two cells wide with a bright yard on both sides is hardly brought up at all. THE PIXEL's own light bounds it: a pixel at or
  over what open ground gets from the sky alone is left as it is (sunlit ground, a sun patch on a shed's floor, the pool under a lamp), and under that
  the gain rolls off as the pixel nears it (place ∕ (1 + (place − 1)·Epix ∕ w)), so brighter stays brighter and nothing lands on one flat level. A
  lamp's own face, a section cap, snow sparkle, beams, fire, the air, the weather and the lit GPU particles (casings, chips) are NOT scaled: a chip on a
  shed's floor reads darker than the floor by the gain. It fades out as the sky's mean radiance falls from 0.35 to 0.08: dusk gets a little, night gets
  none (the dark is the game's). "Hold: plain boxes" and the sweep's `look.all` row put it at 0. The two sky constants in `lookShade` (0.8 / 0.2 and
  0.947 / 0.053) are the hemisphere integrals of `common.wgsl skyRadiance`'s ramp: retune one, redo the other.
  **THE PICTURE ONLY**: guards, teammates and the light meter read the light as it is, so by day a shed LOOKS brighter than it hides you. That is a
  break of "what the AI senses is what the picture shows" by the amount of the gain, ON by default on the prototype page because the maintainer asked
  to see it, and to be settled before any of it goes to the build (the honest version is one exposure for the picture, chosen by where the camera
  looks, which the game can read too). Seen on the software adapter only (the bay at midday); never seen on a GPU, never played.
- **THE LOOK PAGE OPENS A SNOW LEVEL UNDER BROKEN CLOUD, AND ITS PANEL HAS A CLOUD ROW** (`ui/lookpanel.ts LOOK_SNOW_COVER` 0.5, `main.ts`
  `__hour.cover(c)`; the maintainer, 10-25, of the pass at midday on a GPU: "i'd still expect a stronger directional light from the sun in midday").
  What he saw was the game's own rule, not a fault of the hour: the snow weather's cloud is 0.9 (`weatherKinds.ts`), and under that `hours.ts`
  leaves 0.09 of the hour's sun (0.54 of midday's 6), spreads its disc to 0.23 rad and greys the sky: an overcast, with no shadows. (So on his page a
  lantern at a metre was eight times the sun, not equal to it.) `__hour.cover(c)` writes the picked weather's cover for the VISIT and hands the sun
  back to it, so the sun, its disc and the sky follow by the same rule (Kasten and Czeplak's fits): at 0.5 midday's sun is 0.70 of its own (4.2), the
  disc the hour's small one (hard shadows) and the sky 1.66 of its own. It moves the real light: the guards and both meters read it. The night is not
  touched by cloud. NOT carried by a save or a recording (a take made on the look page re-runs elsewhere under the game's 0.9). Whether the GAME's
  snow should fall from broken cloud by day is the weather's owner's and the maintainer's call; nothing outside the look page has moved. Checked on
  the software adapter: the page's boot check reads the sun at midday under 0.5 and 0.9, and one still each of the gate at midday
  (`rebuild/graphics-next/gate-midday-cloud.png`): under 0.9 open snow code 146 / 161 / 184 and the gate's shadow a vague 109 / 127 / 159; under 0.5
  snow 205 / 210 / 219 (not clipped) and a hard-edged shadow 101 / 122 / 159. Never seen on a GPU.
- **THE LOOK PANEL'S "LAMPS BY DAY" ROW** (`lookConfig.lamps`, 0.6 on the look page, 0 = as authored; `engine.ts lookLamps` sets
  `LightSet.localK`, `render/lights.ts upload` applies it; the maintainer, 10-25, of the pass at midday: "we don't have consistent, physically accurate
  light values (lumens?) across the image … a lamp on the ground looks way too bright in daytime mode … same for the flashlight"). He is right, by the
  numbers: every level is authored as a night, and the pass's moon of 0.06 against bulbs that put 4 to 5 on the floor under them is about the real
  proportion (0.2 lux against some 15). The hours then add a sun of 1 to 6, where a real one is 400,000 such moons, and the exposure is nearly one
  number for every hour (1.7 to 2.0). So by day a lantern at a metre (4.5) or a flashlight at 3 m (70 at the lens, 7.8) lights the ground as the midday
  sun does (about 5). The tone map is not the fault; the scene's values are. THE ROW: by day every STEADY light that is not the sun or the moon goes up
  × 10^(−3.7 × amount). 1 = about 1/5,000, a bulb in its real proportion to the sun; the default 0.6 = about 1/170, where the flashlight is right (a
  real weapon light is some 1 % of sunlight at 3 m; the game's is weak beside its own bulbs) and a lantern is lost in the sun. Applied to the UPLOADED
  record alone, so the picture, the bounce, the beams and the GPU's light meter read one number; `RtLight.intensity` is never written. NOT scaled: a
  flash or a blast and a lightning stroke (ttl / transient: theirs is a real brightness the game's numbers never held), an infrared illuminator, a
  device's sight cone (`group 'devices'`), the Team & kit figure's staging (`kitview…`), and every EMISSIVE face (a lamp's glass still glows, and a
  glow card or a headlamp box still lights its surroundings through the bounce as at night: for those "1 = real" is not reached). DAY is the page's
  word, `lookConfig.day` (main.ts: the hour is not `night`), never a guess from a light's strength (41 of 53 levels have a moon of 0.9 and one of 2.6);
  where nobody says, a level lit as a day by its own sky counts by the shade row's ramp, read without the Sky light row. A night is left exactly as it
  was. "Hold: plain boxes" and the sweep's `look.all` do NOT move it (like Sky light: it is the light, not a layer). KNOWN BREAKS, to be settled before
  any of it goes to the build: the game's CPU readers of the list (`guards.ts lightEstimateAt` and its callers: calm torch, power out, morale, night
  vision) still read the authored strength, so by day a man can judge a lamp-lit room as lit that the picture and the GPU meter have as shade; the
  lit fog's own lamp list is authored strength too (not read under the full picture, `FOG.full`); a lamp at 1/5,000 still holds its slot and its range
  in the culling. The honest fix is in the units, not a multiplier at upload: the sun and sky of each hour raised to their real proportion with that
  hour's exposure brought down to match, and the meter's 100 % made relative to the hour. Check: `bun run tools/qa/looklamps-check.ts`
  (`LOOKLAMPS_BREAK=1` must fail; it stands up no game, so it is the same on both stands). Measured on the software adapter, one still each, the pass's
  lorry bay at midday (`rebuild/graphics-next/bay-midday-lamps.png`): the lantern's pool on the bay floor code 195 at 0, 77 at 0.6, 72 at 1 (the floor
  beside it without a lamp); a flashlight's spot on the same floor 187, 71, 68; sunlit snow 219 and the far floor 52 unchanged. Never seen on a GPU,
  never played; dawn and dusk (where the hour's own words say "the lights still on") not looked at.
- **THE LOOK PAGE WITH A GEOMETRY TRIAL ON IS COMPILED WITHOUT THE ROUND TEST** (`main.ts urlFlagsBeforeEngine`: `roundConfig.gpu` is false when
  `lookConfig.on` and a trial has put `cutConfig.swap` off; `?round=1` compiles it in; 10-25). After the build's round things came in by merge, the look
  page lost its SOFTWARE device on its first drawn frame ("A valid external Instance reference no longer exists") where the plain page at the same
  quality drew. Runs that settled it: look with every trial off and `round=0` draws; look with every trial on and `round=0` draws; look with every
  trial on and rounds compiled in dies. The reading (the software adapter's room, above; not bisected further): a trial keeps the cut twin of every ray
  walk live from the first frame and `ROUND_BOXES` adds the round test to each copy. `ROUND.on` (the game's own switch, the debugger's row) is NOT
  moved: only the shader's half. On the pass nothing is lost, because the trial turns the kit's octagons into its own cut prisms before a round thing
  is looked for. NOT so everywhere: the trial takes only octagons stepped 2 mm ± 1 mm (`geoTry.ts octagonAt`) where `round.ts` takes 0.5 to 4.5 mm, so
  on a level whose octagons are stepped otherwise (block, consulate, records) and wherever the panel's Shapes row leaves an octagon alone, a round
  thing is drawn and traced as its square box on this page while the game plays it round. The one-file hosted page takes no address flags, so it
  cannot ask for `round=1`. Whether `?look&round=1` draws on a real GPU: never tried.
  SINCE 10-26 the cut set traces a round as the picture's prism and its box walks no longer hold the round test (`docs/agents/levels.md`, the round
  things' bullet, THE CUT SET): `?look&round=1` with every trial on DREW on the software adapter (119 of 119 pipelines) and lost its device again with
  `&roundexact=1`. The exclusion in `main.ts` is LEFT IN all the same: taking it out changes what this page draws on levels other than the pass, and
  that has not been looked at.
- **THE LOOK PANEL'S PERFORMANCE ROWS** (`ui/lookpanel.ts perfRows`, `ui/perfsend.ts`; the maintainer, 10-25: "it'd be good to have a way to collect a lot
  of perf data so you can see how it runs on my laptop", "i do worry that we have a few stuttering frames even if overall fps is pretty high"). The
  measuring is the F9 recorder and the F8 sweep as they are (`ui/perfrec.ts`, `ui/perfsweep.ts`); the panel adds two buttons and a way out of a page that
  cannot download. Record play = `rec.start` / `rec.stop` round his own play. Price the layers = the sweep over its own rows plus the look's:
  `PerfSweep.extra` is a list of rows a PAGE owns (`{ row, flip }`, the flip made when the sweep arms, undone by its own undo when the sweep is kept
  back), and the panel gives it `look.all` (plain boxes) and one `look.<row>` a layer (not Size, Sky light, Air, Clarity or Untile; Snow relief flips
  to 1, its plain value). On a stop the recorder's own way out runs first, then `takeRead` makes the short read (frame time at the middle, the 95th and
  99th and the worst; counts over 20 / 25 / 33 / 50 / 100 ms; the forty slowest frames outside a sweep's warm-up and settles, each with its CPU parts,
  its GPU cost, the passes that ran over their own middle and what was logged within 0.4 s; every pass as mean and 95th) and shows it in a box with a
  Copy button. A sweep's rows are NOT priced on the page: `tools/qa/perf-report.ts` prices them off the whole take. `sendTake` hands the read and the
  whole take (gzipped, base64, 180,000-character parts) to `window.__takeStore.put(path, doc)` as `takes/<id>` and `takes/<id>/parts/<n>`, one take at a
  time, a failed write tried once more. No page of this repo sets `__takeStore`: a page that hosts the one-file build hands it in, and without it nothing
  is sent and the read sits in the box. `takeRead` was tried headless on made-up takes only; no take has left a page yet.
  Where a store is handed in the recorder's own download is NOT tried (a hosted page starts none, and the try only raises the host's notice over a
  take that did get out). FIRST TAKE FROM THE MAINTAINER'S MAC (10-25, the pass at night, high at half scale, world frozen, 20 rows × 3 rounds): base 15.5
  ms of GPU; every layer of the look together gives back 0.8 ms (5 %), no single layer is outside the noise, the shade row is free. A third button, **Sharp direct**, is `?nosharp` from the panel (`sharpForce.v = false`, then the current preset put on again so its other resolve rows follow; again = as the preset): a hosted page's address takes no flags, and the debugger's own row only holds until the ladder's next preset. Asked for by the performance lane, 10-25, for a take on Auto with it off; not while a take or a sweep runs.
- **POSTS SEATED IN A WALL'S END** (`scene/lookMend.ts seatPosts`, the look page only, `?seat=0` off; the maintainer, 10-25: "seems like a sorting issue
  that's flickering to right of the red door"). The pass's gate post (0.34 m square) stands with one face exactly in the end face of the yard wall it
  closes, so two faces shared a plane and the depth test flipped between the post's render and the wall's stone plinth. On the look page a post (tall,
  8 to 30 cm half both ways, square to the world, drawn, no glass) with a face in the END face on the SAME side of a wall whose section is inside the
  post's grows 4 mm in x and z when the level loads, and rises 4 mm where the two tops are level. A post that only stands AGAINST a wall is not matched.
  Over every level file: 12 posts (pass 2, gwot-yard 2, police-post 2, tut-sky 2, snatch 2, depot 1, depot-gwot 1); the console says how many. The level
  file is not touched: the right mend is in the level's own numbers, found by `tools/qa/zfight-check.ts` (`levels.md`). Never seen on a GPU.
- **THE CHARACTER LAB** (`host/charlab.ts`, opened from the look panel; the maintainer, 10-25: "men up close look pretty good, but not perfect. IMO we
  should just iterate on the characters in a character lab or the workbench"). Not a page of its own: on the running look page the camera is pinned on
  YOU at a man's height (`FollowCamera.setPin` every frame; Angle, Height, Distance, Looks at, or turning slowly), you wear any variant of the cast
  (`cast.ts castWear`, two arrows) and are painted as the SIDE of that outfit (`charLook.ts`), except in a mission that has you in the sneaking suit,
  where every outfit is the suit. Nobody notices or hurts you while it is open: `playerInvisible` and `godMode` are raised once on Open, only where they
  were down, and Leave puts down only what the lab raised, with your own outfit and the free camera back. You walk the mannequin into the light you want
  to judge him in. THE EYE STAYS ON YOUR SIDE OF A WALL (`charLabFrame`: `col.segmentBlocked` from the look point to the eye and to a point 0.25 m to
  either side of it, the distance bisected and 0.25 m kept off the wall); where that leaves it nearer than three quarters of the distance asked (3.8 m by default: the lens is a long one, 28°, and shows a man whole from about 3.6 m) it looks from the roomiest of the twelve
  angles a twelfth of a turn apart, a nearer one preferred. Coming in is at once, going back out is eased. `quietUtility` is raised with the two
  flags, as a show has it, so NO CHECKPOINT is written while the lab is open (`savestate.ts runNo`): a file with the lab's unseen player in it could
  be loaded later with nothing to put the flag down. `window.__charlab` = `{ state, open, leave, wear, worn, outfits }`. Sam keeps his own
  weapon in any outfit. Never seen on a GPU.
- **A HOUSE FRONT DRESSED BY HAND, A TRIAL** (`src/scene/frontTry.ts dressFront`; the look page only; the maintainer, 10-23, of the pass's tea house seen
  from over its yard: "this looks a bit too "regular" -- especially the face of the building we're looking at", and a minute before "the art style just
  needs a lot of iteration. right now it does look a bit procedural"). The answer tried is AUTHORING, not another layer of noise: one wall gone over
  piece by piece after the level loads (as the geometry trial does; `levels/pass.json` is not touched), every number placed by hand. The three windows
  differ (boards, shutters, a blanket nailed over), the two red panels differ (one worn, one plastered over), mends of other mud, a spout with its
  streak and ice, beam ends under the roof line, split wood under a window, a ladder leaned over the level's own planks, a plank bench with a can and
  a pot, a few mud bricks at the wall's end. Made of what the engine has: plain and tilted boxes (`Box.rot`), twelve-sided prisms for round timber
  (`cutRound` about z, a thin picture-only disc for the end grain) and thin cut boxes for flat shapes with an uneven outline. ONE MODEL: what closes a
  window is a REAL box (sight, a round and the room's lamp stop at a board, a shutter, the blanket and pass between the boards), as is what stands on
  the ground (none within a stride of a door; the swung shutter stands out at head height beside the planks) and the beam ends over every head; only
  what lies flat on the wall is picture only, as the level's own panels are. COLOURS are the level palette's rows darkened in one piece (`of(row, k)`,
  0.55 < k < 0.99), so `lookClass` gives each piece its map: a hand-picked colour between two rows gets none. Traps met: the wall past x = 28 at that
  z is a partition INSIDE the bunk room, and the yard wall there has a door between its two panels; the level already stacks planks at x 21.4 to 22.85.
  KNOWN: a tilted box takes no map and no clinging snow from the look (`lookSurface` leaves `BOX_ROT` alone) and a cut piece takes snow only about y;
  a wall charge there leaves the pieces above a hand's height hanging (`scene/lookTidy.ts` takes a decal with its wall only from the foot). It knows
  the house by three of its file's boxes (the two red panels, the second window's pane) and does nothing on any other level. Switch: `?front=0` or the
  look panel's 'Dressed by hand' button (kept on the machine as `twopointsix.fronttry`; the page loads again); needs cut boxes on, and holds the cut
  programs in from boot as the geometry trial does. Not a rule of the game: no knob, no journal key; the men's routes and sight along that wall change
  on that page. If the look goes to the build this belongs in the level's file or its kit, not in code. Checked: 98 pieces placed, none malformed,
  none in the level's own solids or by a door (a script over the loaded level); drawn on the software adapter only.
- **A LORRY WITH CURVES, A TRIAL** (`src/scene/lorryTry.ts dressLorry`; the look page only, with cut boxes on; `?lorry=0` = the lorry as its file has
  it, or the look panel's 'Curved' button, kept on the machine as `twopointsix.lorrytry`; the page loads again). The maintainer, 10-24, on a GPU picture of the pass's yard: "some curved surfaces on the truck would go a long way". The
  pass's lorry (twenty boxes under four flat slabs of snow) is gone over by hand after the level loads, as the house front is; `levels/pass.json` is not
  touched and the pieces are found by where the generator put them (`tools/levels/pass.ts LORRY`): any one missing = nothing is touched. The tilt is bowed
  over four hoops with its snow on the bow; the cab's roof is an arch from a leaned windscreen back; the bonnet is a narrow engine cover with a round top
  between two fenders that arch over the front wheels; wheels, hubs, lamp pods and a tank under the bed each side are round. 21 boxes added, 16 changed.
  AN ARC (`Box.cutArc`, new): a round prism (`cutRound`) turns its normal about the box's own middle, which makes a drum but not a roof. With `cutArc` =
  k metres the axis lies k UNDER the box's centre, so a box whose top is cut to seven facets of a wide circle (its top face + six planes) is shaded as
  that circle. It rides in the record's unused LAST row (`cut.ts packCut`: `CUT_PAD`'s w + k; every reader of a plane stops at the first zero normal),
  so an arc carries seven planes at most (an eighth plane drops the arc without a word); about x or z only. In `gbuffer_cut.wgsl` its facets and top
  turn (the box's own upright faces and underside stay flat), the look's paint is read straight down each quarter (no unrolling), its ends get no drum's
  rim, and an arc in the snow paint gets `snowBox`'s snow (grain, glow, the wandering edge) asked as the box's top face, and is drawn as a SHEET: its
  upright faces and ends are discarded (they stood as straight lines where the wandering edge drew back), so a cap lies two centimetres over its roof.
  Picture only: every ray meets the facets. A round's rolled rim is now on both end faces (a wheel shows one to each side).
  WHAT A RAY AND A BODY MEET CHANGES on that page: the bonnet (1.5 m high, 0.98 m a side) is a hump 0.56 m a side that tops out at 1.46 m, with a
  fender of at most 1.08 m beside it and, for 0.63 m in front of each fender, only the 0.78 m bumper; the tilt's eaves come down from 1.95 m to 1.6 m;
  a tank closes a metre of the gap under the bed each side. No knob and no journal key, as the geometry trial.
  KNOWN: no clinging snow from the look on an arc (the round's snow hook is about y only), so the authored caps are all the snow there is; the level's banks against the lorry are as they were; the lorry is found by twenty
  numbers copied from the generator, and the console says so when one misses.
  Checked: `dressLorry` on `levels/pass.json` under bun (21 added, 16 changed, every record seven planes or fewer where it is an arc); the page booted
  on the software adapter with 0 console errors; four pictures (play camera, the nose, from above, dusk). Never seen on a GPU.
- **THE MEN ON THE LOOK PAGE, A FIRST ROUND** (`shaders/look.wgsl lookMan`, called from `gbuffer.wgsl fsSkin`; the maintainer, 10-23: "we need to spend a
  LOT of time using these layers to make the characters look awesome. I think that's the next big frontier"). A man was one flat colour a material
  slot with the mesh's creases; here each slot is drawn as the stuff it is, in his BIND pose (nothing swims as he moves), by his side and a number of
  his own: cloth (thread from the cloth map round each limb, folds that ring the limb and gather at knee, hip, ankle and elbow as a relief the lamps
  light, an operator's print cut from his own colour, dust on the knees, age), webbing (rows of tape, rubbed edges), helmet (cover, chips), metal
  (bright edges, an oiled sheen), boots, skin (tone, the cold in the face, a day's growth), and on a snow level snow caked on the boots and hems (a CAP on helmets and shoulders was here until 10-24: out on the maintainer's word, see round three). Carried by one float: `vsSkin` packs slot + 16 x side (and, since round four, + 128 x the cast part) into `fin.w` on that page only (`charMaterials.ts charLookSides`, raised by
  main.ts with the look), where the build keeps 1. Amount: the panel's Men row (`look=men:0` = the men as the build draws them; `window.__look.set({
  men })` for a scripted picture). KNOWN GAPS: the tilted normal is stored as a man's normal always was (alpha 1), so the working-size passes read
  the folds too: on a GPU look for crawl on cloth under the denoiser; the print and folds are noise, which is the "procedural" he named, so authored
  maps for the men are the next round; nothing here has been seen on a GPU.
- **THE MEN, ROUND TWO: TAILORING** (`shaders/look.wgsl manCut` and the slots' own blocks in `lookMan`; amount `lookCfg.g.y`, the panel's Kit detail row,
  `look=tailor:0` = round one alone). Round one was print, folds and wear, all of it noise, and he had called the page "a bit procedural": round two
  draws what a person CUT AND SEWED, placed by hand on the body in the bind pose. The cast stands in a T: an arm runs out along x round (y 1.435,
  z -0.068) from |x| 0.22 to 0.70, a leg up along y round (|x| 0.093, z -0.045 at the shin to 0.01 at the thigh), an operator's helmet is y 1.65 to 1.86,
  his boots y 0.03 to 0.27, his knee pads y 0.47 to 0.60 (measured from the cast, not guessed: see the preview below). OPERATORS: a combat shirt (the
  body under the plates plain knit, only the sleeves printed; collar and short zip), a sleeve pocket with its flap and a loop field carrying a patch
  and a tape, doubled elbows and knees and seat, the out seam stitched twice, cuffs and hems; the webbing's tape sewn down every 38 mm (a bar tack in
  colour and relief: this is what makes a vest read as load-bearing kit); a helmet cover with four seams from the crown, a band with two cat's eyes at
  the back, loop squares on the sides and a rubber rim; sand-coloured rough-out boots with laces between eyelets, a padded collar and a welt (side 0
  only: the dark suit keeps dark boots and gloves); knee pads as hard caps scraped pale; gloves with a sand back, a dark palm and a knuckle bar. THE
  OTHER SIDE: a shirt's placket with buttons, collar band and cuffs; loose trousers and the shirt's skirt hang in long vertical folds (relief); the
  waistcoat is wool in a twill; headgear is felted wool. The shader has slot and side but NOT the part, so a shawl or scarf in `cloth_plain` gets the
  shirt's lines too, and every hat is "wool": a part id in `fin` is the next step if that shows (round four carries it, for the webbing). WGSL TRAP: `patch` and `loop` are reserved words.
  A PREVIEW WITHOUT THE PAGE made this round possible (a still of the men costs ten minutes here): rasterise the cast in its bind pose under bun
  (`tools/qa/headless.ts loadCastCharacter`, `charMaterials.ts charSlots`) into point / normal / slot / cavity buffers for a front, back, side and top
  view, then shade them with a numpy stand-in of `lookMan` (two seconds a man); design there, port to WGSL after. The stand-in is not in the repo (it
  would drift): the shader is the truth. Never seen on a GPU; on the page only the software renderer has drawn it.
- **THE MEN, ROUND THREE: THE PRINT, AND CLOTHES THAT WERE WORN** (`shaders/look.wgsl manCamo2`, `manPrint`, `manWorn`; the print's amount is
  `lookCfg.g.z`, the panel's Printed cloth row, `look=print:0` = the first print; the worn clothes ride the Kit detail row). The maintainer's second
  point was "we also need to get away from the pixel art textures", and the first print was that on a sleeve: one value noise cut at a level, whose
  blobs come out square-shouldered along the lattice and read as big pixels up close. `manCamo2` is the print as it is on the bolt: a ground that
  drifts from tan to sage with no edge, hard-edged shapes of green and of brown over it, cream flecks, dark twigs in the green; each field is three
  octaves and every octave is turned off the last one's lattice (`manRot0` / `manRot1`), which is what takes the squares out. Sixteen noise taps a
  printed pixel where the first print took six. THE OTHER SIDE'S one set of clothes (`manWorn`, `cloth_plain` on every side but the operators'): the
  road in the trouser legs to a ragged line below the knee and on the seat, grime at the cuffs, the collar and where a man wipes his hands, rubbed
  elbows, sweat down the back, a breast pocket with its flap (`manCut`), and on about half the men a stripe in the weave; a responder's duty shirt
  takes under half the dirt and no stripe. The dirt is the side's own grime colour at half strength, so it darkens a pale shirt and dusts a dark one.
  NO SNOW LIES ON A MAN (the maintainer on a GPU, 10-24: "weird that the men are covered in snow, shouldn't happen"): the cap on helmets and
  shoulders is out, after three tries at making it smaller; only the cake on boots and hems stays. Do not put it back. (He saw the cap on a GPU; the build without it booted on the
  software adapter with no console errors and has not been seen on a GPU.)
  The print and the worn clothes were designed in the bind-pose preview, then ported; never seen on a GPU.
- **THE MEN, ROUND FOUR: A PLATE CARRIER THAT IS MADE, AND THE PART REACHES THE PIXEL** (`shaders/look.wgsl manWeb`, `manVest`, `manRigPouch`; rides
  the Kit detail row; `look=tailor:0` = round one's webbing with every other sewn thing gone too: no setting shows round two's carrier beside this). A close picture of the squad showed
  the weakest thing on the page: rounds one and two taped EVERY webbing pixel, so a carrier was a wall of bricks from collar to belt, shoulders,
  packs and straps alike, the "procedural" look he had named. THE PART ID NOW RIDES TO THE FRAGMENT (round two's known gap): `gbuffer.wgsl vsSkin`
  adds 128 × the vertex's cast part to `fin.w` on the look page (`code` = slot + 16 × side + 128 × part, 4043 at most, exact in the float), and
  the page says which parts matter once its cast is loaded (`gbuffer.ts lookParts`: 1 + the index of `op_suit` and of `chest_rig`, 0 = this cast
  has none, sent as `lookCfg.g.w`). `manWeb` sorts a webbing pixel four ways. (1) THE OPERATORS' CARRIER (the webbing of `op_suit`, side 0 only:
  the dark suit keeps its black harness as it was): tape rows only on the front panel (to 1.345 m), the back panel (to 1.385 m) and the
  cummerbund, lower in relief (1.1 mm, was 2.2) and drawn as paler tape on the cloth, not as dark gaps; above them a plain plate bag with a
  seam and the plate's clipped corners stitched through; a loop field on the chest with a name tape (its letters only marks) and a flag in two
  drab tones; on the back a drag handle under the collar (a doubled strap boxed and crossed at each end, standing 2.8 mm off) and a loop field
  with a call-sign tape and a glint square; shoulder straps padded between two rows of stitching, a buckle where each meets the front; a bound
  hem. (2) HIS OTHER KIT (the `kit_*` packs, the chin strap): plain cloth, no tape. (3) A DEFENDER'S CANVAS CHEST RIG (`chest_rig`): no tape; a
  twill, each pouch under a flap whose edge is stitched across at the toggle and stands 1.6 mm proud, a stitched hem. (0) Everything else (the
  responders' kit, a cast with no such parts) as before. Everything on the carrier is placed by bind-pose coordinates on the one mesh the cast
  has, and the part is found by its NAME in the page's boot (`main.ts`): another carrier mesh needs its own numbers, and nothing checks them.
  KNOWN: the pouches on the carrier's front are `op_suit` too, so the tape rows run over them and the front seam crosses the chest pouch; the canvas rig's pouch mask is "the front of him between two heights", so the belt's front arc takes the hem line; a
  pack on a man's back hides the handle and the back's loop field from most angles. SEEN: the numpy preview of `operator_2` and `defender_4`
  (bind pose, four views) and the squad of four on the pass at dawn on the software adapter (very low, one seed, 119 of 119 pipelines, no
  errors). Never seen on a GPU; the defenders' rig never seen on the page at all.
- **BIG HAND-MADE RELIEF: STONE, MUD BRICK, PLANKS, DAUBED MUD** (`render/lookTex.ts`; the look page only; the maintainer, 10-23, sent two stills of a
  2005 stealth game, a stone stairwell and a dark brick room, as the materials reference: "this looks pretty good and it's pretty much all materials,
  right?"). What those stills have that noise does not: FEATURES A PERSON CAN NAME, each a few centimetres to half a metre, under one raking light.
  So the maps were redrawn as things, not spectra: `wood` = eight rough-sawn boards of their own widths with wandering gaps, raised hard grain, knots
  with swirl, checks from the butts, saw strokes on some, grey boards beside brown, nails with rust runs; `mud` = hand daubs with finger strokes and lap
  ridges, a flaked last coat with a crisp ragged edge, one long crack net and fine crazing, straw, pebbles and the holes they left. Two NEW layers, 11
  `field stone` (a jittered lattice of stones each proud by 2 to 5 cm with its own lean, clefts, chips, four rock colours, lichen) and 12 `mud brick`
  (sixteen courses, a wandering bond, washed-out joints, crumbled and missing bricks). They are on no class: `look.wgsl lookSurface` lays them INTO a
  mud wall wider than 0.6 m and taller than 0.24 m, stacked pieces included (the MASONRY block): a plinth of field stone to a wandering line about 0.35 m up with a
  drip shadow under the render's lip, and mud brick showing in ragged holes where the render has fallen, more of them low on the wall, each with a
  lit lip. Panel row Stonework (`look=stone:0` = plain mud walls). `LookCfg` grew to 7 vec4 (f.w stone, g.x marks); `LOOK_ROUGH` is read for the first
  eleven layers only (the two new ones carry their base roughness in the block). TRAPS: a coursed map must never sit on a layer `untile` reads twice
  (the second read is turned 0.61 rad: courses cross); the plinth's line is in world y, so a mud wall on a slope would step. A map can be judged
  without the page: bake `lookLayer(n)` under bun and shade it flat, raked and top-lit (2 s a layer) before any still is asked for. Nothing here has
  been seen on a GPU.
- **MARKS AS PAINT, A FIRST TRY** (`shaders/markings.wgsl markSoft`, behind `lookMarkSoft()` = `lookCfg.g.x`, 0 off the look page by gbuffer.ts's
  stub; the maintainer, 10-23: "we also need to get away from the pixel art textures"). A marking is still the level's 2-bit cell bitmap (2.5 cm
  cells), but on the look page it is not drawn as squares: the coverage is read over a one-cell footprint, cut back at half cover along a ragged line
  (noise by box and marking, so two signs do not share an edge), the shares sharpened so two colours meet in a line and not a blur, and thin rubbed
  patches let the surface through. An emissive entry keeps its cells (a lamp's face must not lose light), and past about 1.75 cells a pixel it is the
  plain coverage again (nothing to draw). Panel row Painted marks (`look=marks:0` = square cells; what the row does today: THE ROW ON A GPU, below). The bitmaps themselves are still the level's: a
  mark that is a coarse picture stays a coarse picture with soft edges, so authored marks at a finer cell are the round after. Never seen on a GPU.
  THE SOFT READ IS ITS OWN (`markSoftRead`, 10-24), one read of the four cells around the pixel. (1) A PLAIN BILINEAR RAMP between cell centres.
  The first try read `markTaps` at a one-cell footprint, which is already a quarter into its minified mean: 0.75 of the ramp + 0.25 of the nearest
  cell, a step on every cell edge, so the cut sat on the cell edges and a staircase stayed a staircase with round corners. (2) A STROKE THAT RUNS
  CORNER TO CORNER IS JOINED: where two cells of one paint meet only at a corner and the other two of the block are bare, the ramp is exactly half
  cover at the corner (a stepped diagonal was a string of beads). The bridge adds cover there for that paint (a neck about 0.8 of a cell, as wide as
  the stroke), so the pass gate's diamond is one painted line. NOT joined: two solid blocks meeting at a corner (the rugs' chequers of 2 by 2 squares;
  the same rule leaves two bare cells meeting inside a painted field alone), a chequer of single cells, a paint that burns. Counted over
  `levels/*.json`: 6,903 such corners in 8,075 marks; 4,608 are block corners and 36 a single-cell chequer (bazaar.json), left as they were; 2,259
  are joined, in 748 marks. Among those are specks that touch at a corner (the dots of writing on a paper, rust speckle), which now fuse. KNOWN: it
  reads its own record, so a corner on the seam between two records of one face is not joined (347 of them, most on rugs laid as four records, where
  the block rule skips them anyway); the bridge is paint the far read (the plain coverage past 1.75 cells a pixel) and a reflection (`markHit`) do
  not have, so a joined stroke is about a tenth heavier up close than far off. A wider smooth read (a B-spline over the cells, cut at 0.4) was tried
  first and DROPPED: it filled one-cell holes (the police post's lattice), washed out a lone cell of one paint inside another, and did not keep the
  cover. Seen on the software adapter at the pass gate (the diamond is one line, the bars have a brushed edge), a rug (the lozenges are slanted and
  round, no steps) and a crate; never on a GPU. TRAP: the corner test first read its eight cells in two chains of `&&` over `markCell` calls, and
  with that the software adapter never finished the look page's first frame (three boots of three; every pipeline compiled, no error). It is one
  call site in a loop over `MK_BRIDGE` now. A page boot that reports its pipelines says nothing until a frame is drawn.
  **THE ROW ON A GPU (10-25).** First: "turning on and off painted marks doesn't seem to do anything?" A test picture at the top of the row (red = how
  near the soft read counts the pixel, green = its cover, blue = an entry that burns) showed the soft read working on his GPU: red patches, smooth green
  lines, the diamond one slanted line. Then, with the read proven: "painted marks still doesn't look like it does anything until 2 where it's really
  overdone" (2 was that test picture, read as the effect). CAUSE: at the distance the game is played from a cell is about two pixels, so a rounded
  corner or a ragged edge is under a pixel; only a change of tone or of a whole stroke shows. THE ROW NOW (`markSoft`, 0 to 2, 1 the default; the test
  picture is out): the SHAPE as before (all of it by 1); the HAND, the cut wandering slowly along the stroke (`0.5 + 0.32 × row × (noise - 0.5)` over
  20 cm, clamped 0.22 to 0.82: a stripe a cell wide is 0.85 to 1.15 of one at 1); the WEAR, paint rubbed thin in patches of 9 and 30 cm measured in
  METRES on the face (`pm = cell × texel`: a fine mark and a coarse one wear alike), a quarter of it touched at 1 and half at 2, up to 0.85 gone, each
  patch fading at its rim; the AGE (`markTone`), the paint's own colour 0.82 of the frame's marking contrast at 1 and 0.64 at 2. A burning entry keeps
  cells and colour. JUDGED BY EYE on the software adapter, the pass gate at midday, 480×300 at scale 1 from 5.2 m (his cells to a pixel): 0 = crisp
  stripes and a stepped diamond; 1 = stripes nearly straight with faded lengths and round ends, the diamond a drawn line; 2 = stripes half gone. A
  first cut swung the stroke's width more than twice as far over half the length (0.7, 11 cm): a row of stripes read as dripped wax, so it was halved.
  KNOWN: the wear is noise by box and marking, not by where a thing is rubbed (a gate's foot, a rug's middle); writing made of single cells loses
  letters at 2; the far read and a reflection (`markHit`) have none of it. The reworked row has never been seen on a GPU.
