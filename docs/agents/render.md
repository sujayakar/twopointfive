## Judging renderer output

Whole-frame captures downscaled into a chat hide exactly the defects that matter (penumbra stipple, ragged
iso-contours at a spot edge, probe-sized blotches, sparkle near small emitters, discs around dim lights). Crop
200–400 px tiles around shadow edges / light-pool boundaries / emitters, upscale 3–4×, compare before/after tiles,
and look at the debug views (`engine.settings.debugView`: direct-only, indirect-only) as well as the composite.
`sips -c H W --cropOffset Y X` + `sips -Z` does it on macOS. For "lossless" claims use the pixel A/B harness:
`?paused` boot, identical stepping, `__png` both variants, diff (max/mean/>2/>8 counts) against a same-variant
noise floor captured the same way; when A/B-ing smoke shading freeze the field with `smoke.params.frozen = true` (holds
the field AND still renders it — `enabled=false` renders no smoke at all, so any smoke A/B passes vacuously).
Determinism checklist for captures (learned the hard way): zero every character's `anim.phase` (it is seeded with
`Math.random()`; the idle / breathing / weight-shift clocks are desynced from the character id — deterministic, leave them), park the guards AND their torches somewhere they light nothing (or disable the torches), seed
`Math.random` if emitters are involved, never let the rAF loop run between boot and capture (`?paused` + a
screenshot to give the pane a size, then only `__runFrames`), and for views with MEN ON SCREEN call `game.restartEncounter()` right
after seeding `Math.random` and before staging (the guards' construction-time dice — glance clocks, waits — were drawn unseeded at boot,
and a staged man's head otherwise sits differently boot to boot). With that, two boots are bit-identical in every view;
`tools/qa/rig-identity.js` (`__idrun`) is the recipe end to end (corridor / lobby / cubicles stills with 2–4 men, hashable across boots at every preset).
**ONE CONFIG PER FRESH BOOT** for every identity pass and every look A/B (learned again on the smoke lab): two stagings inside one page never compare — the cubicles'
flickering fixtures, the haze clock, the TAAU phase, the storm and the wind all key on the game / render clocks and the frame index, which the first run has advanced by
the time the second starts — so navigate afresh (`?paused`), run the SAME call sequence from boot for each build / setting (cross-build claims: main served BESIDE the lane on
its own port, both driven identically) and compare the hashes / PNGs left on the sink by name (`__rf.identity / pngs`, `__idrun` are that shape).
Numbers and hashes recorded before 08-12 reproduce only with that day's new defaults off (`?nogatherstrata&nomotioncalm`, and `?noiq` for anything from before the image-quality
program); harnesses that hash against main served beside stay valid, since both sides boot the same defaults.

## GPU timing — known traps

`engine.timer` timestamps are per pass. **Render-pass** timestamps (gbuffer/composite/post/fxaa) on Metal span the
wait for the drawable and read ≈ one frame — ignore them (the HUD lists compute passes only). Scripted
`__runFrames` stepping returns stale timer values UNLESS each frame is followed by `await device.queue.onSubmittedWorkDone()`
+ a MessageChannel yield: that serializes frames (no cross-frame overlap inflating passes) and lets the readbacks resolve
even with the pane hidden — two 30-frame baselines then agree to ~0.02 ms and match the live HUD (this is how the trade-off
options were timed). Without it, hidden-pane numbers are garbage. Interleave A/B/A/B either way. Reference numbers (M4 Max, high, calm office, renderer v3): ≈ 10–11 ms union at 1368×770 with the
08-12 defaults (sharp direct + GBAA, motion-calm, gatherStrata, near mesh shadows at high — docs/internal/trace-perf.md §0 / render-defects-0812.md carry those takes; ≈ 8–10 ms before them) — see docs/perf/v3-gate-phase4.json and
docs/internal/p2a-restir.md for per-pass tables (the pre-v3 frame was ~20 ms: direct ≈7, softblur ≈3, gather ≈6, cascades ≈2, volumetrics ≈1). **The GPU is SHARED with every other lane's page** (and the
maintainer's own tab): a take that overlaps someone else's measurement is worthless — `sh tools/qa/gpu-quiet.sh` waits for `ioreg` Device Utilization to sit under 8 % before a take, rounds are
interleaved and filtered to their quiet minimum, and a row whose p75 sits far above its median is quoted as contended, never as a result.

- **Markings = object legibility** — palette-indexed bitmaps on box faces, packed in the tail of `boxMat` (no texture); `settings.markings` default ON, `?nomarkings` (+ `?level=relief` = main's frame), `__mark`; emissive markings are LIGHTS; the art rules (flat colour per cell, ≤ 3 entries, no gradients, no baked lighting) — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Materials, RT reflections, the detail layer** (renderer v3 phase 4) — every box carries a finish (`Box.rough / metal / aniso`), `reflect.wgsl` traces under `settings.rtReflect` (`?nortreflect`, `frame.rtCfg.w` 0 = off), the detail layer under `settings.detail` (`?detail=0‥1`; art rule: variation from geometry, never a painted texture); `__rt`, `__hotReflect` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **The ultra-only extras** (renderer v3 phase 5) — `settings.giResample` / `rtMeshHits` / `rtHitReuse`, only the ultra preset raises them, `?nop5` vetoes; `__gi`, `__hotGather`; TRAP kept here: `reflect_p5.wgsl` is a separate program from `reflect.wgsl` on purpose (main's text) — keep the two files in step — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Character proxies = the SDF character rig** — every mannequin's 15 shadow / reflection proxies are round cones fitted at load (`render/sdfrig.ts`, `shaders/sdfrig.wgsl`), no switch; extras in `frame.rigCfg` (`settings.charSelfShadow` default ON, `?noselfshadow`; `?sdfsmooth` / `?charsoft` / `?charsoftmarch` experiments); `__sdfrig`, `__rigTrace` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.

- **Effects numbers** are tuned by the user in the viewer and pasted back; treat `effects.ts` / `RIG` values as
  authored data — change them only from viewer readouts or explicit notes. (`effects.ts tracerFx` — tracer speed / shutter /
  thickness / emissive / head-light intensity + range / ember / pool caps — ships UNTUNED: viewer Guard ▸ carbine: tracers (K),
  or Tab ▸ Effects ▸ tracer rows in the corridor at night, then paste back.)
- **No dollhouse wall cutaway** in the game — it was removed by user decision (they rotate the camera instead — Ctrl + mouse orbits and Ctrl + wheel zooms now, host/loop.ts; Q / E are the wall hold and the holster);
  don't bring it back. The `Cutaway` box flag + `cutHeight` primitive survives only for the viewer stage's back wall.
  Debug/sandbox actions are debugger (tweak panel) buttons, not hotkeys.
- **Quality**: `ui/quality.ts` presets (ultra / high / medium / low / verylow) set resolution scale + internal-height cap, beam steps,
  cache grid, smoke iterations, the direct-light ray budget (8/4/3 · 8/4/3 · 6/3/3 · 4/2/2 · 1/1/2), `directHistory` (0.5; high and verylow 0.7)
  AND the lossy trade-offs below (ultra none · high checker + third-res gather + dimRays · medium/low/verylow those + quarter-res beams, with
  staggered cascade refresh `rcPeriods` in place of `rcHalfRate`; low/verylow with `dimRaysBelow` 0.02) AND the final gather's relative firefly bound `settings.giFireflyK` (4 on high‥verylow; 0 = off on ultra:
  the bound is a one-sided clamp — it cut the boil round a torch on a wall by ~40 % but costs up to a quarter of the bounce within ~0.6 m
  of an intense hotspot — so the reference preset runs without it; Tab ▸ Indirect light slider for A/B) — applying a preset writes those
  settings exactly as the menu rows do; a row flipped by hand sticks until the next preset change. `auto` first CALIBRATES behind the start card (a couple of seconds of GPU compute-pass timings → a per-pass
  cost model, `COST`/`REF`/`FACTOR` in quality.ts: per-pixel and fixed factors per preset → preset AND scale in one step, remembered
  per machine; ladder verylow‥high, never ultra; 'auto' picked later on the pause card / Tab runs the SAME path — `Quality.startAuto`:
  from this machine's remembered pick + scale, re-measured behind that card, the card's note refreshed when it settles), then a runtime ladder trims (proportional scale steps toward LADDER.aimFps 50, cut below 45 / restore above 58, ≥ 2 s apart on a 0.05 grid, preset drop
  once a real cut is off, floor SCALE_FLOOR 0.5). THOSE ARE THE 'AS NOW' BANDS: since 10-10 the ladder's default is HOLD 60 (`settings.ladderAim` 60, the maintainer's pick; `?aim=asnow` or `?aim=0` = the bands above for the visit, `?aim=90|120|display` other targets, Tab ▸ Frame ▸ 'ladder: frame rate to hold'; `ui/quality.ts HOLD / ladderBands`): the same climb, but two 1-s windows under ~58 fps with the GPU the limit cut the scale straight to what the cost model says holds 60 (to the floor, then the preset under auto), and pixels come back on measured GPU room; a page something else paces is left alone (as now: `settings.ladderPaced`, `?ladderpaced=0`; under an aim, since 10-14: `settings.ladderHeld`, default on, `?ladderheld=0` or Tab ▸ Frame ▸ 'ladder: an aim leaves a held page alone' = an aim as it was. The maintainer's Mac on a low battery, 10-14: the browser held the page at 30 fps, the GPU clocked down and read ~1.5× longer, and hold 60 stepped High from 770 to 600 rows for a rate that stayed 30. What cut it (read off the code and the replay, not the budget rule first blamed): the union at High's start read 13.9 ms on the slow clock, over the 13.33 ms back-off band, so the `hot` rule took a step every two windows, and the strict restore (the next step priced under 12.0 ms) never gave one back. On, the as-now paced check runs under an aim too: (a) a slow window is PROVEN paced when the union fits the aim's frame less HOLD.pacedMs (10.67 ms at 60) and the frame is more than those 6 ms over it; (b) slow, not GPU-bound, not proven, no pace known: over the back-off band the band's own step goes first as ever (and is judged like any cut); inside it, a judged cut to the highest scale the cost model prices under that floor (none where the scale floor cannot reach it: a small window, a union far over; a step further if it lands short). Proven there, the frame decides: no shorter = the pixels straight back to where the chain began, the failed-rung marks it left restored, that rate remembered as the page's pace; shorter by PACED.probeGain (15 %: a missed vsync bought back is a whole refresh, less is the rate's own wobble) = the cut stays and the level it left is a failed rung; no step up while a cut waits for its verdict; (c) a cut that proves nothing by the end of its 12 s trial goes back to where it started with no pace learnt, the next held off 60 s, doubling; after a judged take-back the next cut comes no sooner than the re-test would; (d) at the pace: no cut for the union's size, no `hot` step, no preset starved, and a scale under the tier's start comes back a grid step at a time on the frame's own room, each step judged (the frame grew = the step off and the pace forgotten); (e) the pace is dropped for a re-test after PACED.recheckSecs (120 s, doubling), which is those same judged cuts again (about 10 s under the tier's start). Check: `ladder-replay.ts --selftest`, the 'page something else holds' block (sixteen cases: held five minutes, the hold lifting, arriving cut, a fight on a held page, a fixed 60 Hz display missing vsync under and over the band, real load, the re-test, the marks, four never-held machines with other overheads, auto, a cut that tells nothing, a machine the cost model is wrong about, the failed rung after a cut that helped, a CPU-bound frame that wobbles, nothing holding); `LADDERHELD_BREAK=1` in front must FAIL eight of its lines (exit 1). Measured 10-14, headless only, after two reviews (the second found a never-held fixed 60 Hz machine left 25 % short of pixels, a cut / step up / cut loop where the model is wrong, a sawtooth after a cut that helped, and cuts repeating on a wobbling rate: all four mended and now cases above): off = the tree before it move for move (600 fuzz machines, as now either way and an aim with it off, four sets: no outside holds / real ones × overhead inside 6 ms / up to 9); on, machines nothing ever held spend the same seconds under 58 fps with overhead inside 6 ms (within 0.1 s of 400) and fewer past it (a fixed display: 116 → 105 of 400, the judged cut finds a missed vsync the old rule let be); with holds coming and going, about 0.5 s more per machine under 58 fps outside the held spells, fixed 60 Hz +4.6 s of 197 (the limit below). 84 steadily held machines whose GPU time follows the pixels more or less than the model says: 26 keep more pixels, 50 the same, 8 lose under 0.015 of mean scale (the trial dips). His take 5 replayed (`--aim 60 --sweeps`, a sweep take, so read the rows only): mean 573 rows off, 730 on. His two F9 takes: identical moves off and on. The real page on the software adapter at his window size, fed held windows through its own ladder (`Quality.simulate`): ×0.75 at 3 s, ×0.70 at 6 s, ×0.55 at 9 s, ×0.77 again at 12 s and for the rest of two minutes; `?ladderheld=0` ends ×0.70. KNOWN LIMITS: a fight that starts on a held page before its pace is known, or a re-test inside one, is cut as before until it is over (the floor cannot bring 23 ms under 10.7); where the model says the scale floor cannot reach the proof's floor, nothing changes; a hold lifting mid-fight on a fixed 60 Hz display, with no fast second between, waits for the re-test; a hold that lifts and comes back inside the hold-off sits at ×0.70 as before until the next judged cut; a frame rate that wobbles 15 % a second by itself can read as a cut that helped (one step under the tier's start then stays held off); everything rests on HOLD.pacedMs = 6 as the frame's overhead past the union. The replay tool's own held-frame test (`heldOut`) stays apart from `holdProof` on purpose: it re-prices a RECORDED frame and knows the take's display rate, which the ladder does not. Never seen on a GPU or a held browser). `bun run tools/qa/ladder-replay.ts --selftest | <F9 take> --check | --aim 60` = the ladder replayed headless over a recording; quality-plan.ts's ladder checks pin as-now. Since 08-12 the ladder also CLIMBS on measured headroom (`settings.ladderClimb`, default on; `capClimb` off): union-driven,
  0.05 a rung up to ×0.95 (1.0 would drop sharp direct), then gather ⅓ → ½ and beams ¼ → ½, backing off newest-first with doubling holds; 'cruising' is judged from
  the GPU union priced at the next preset by the cost model (`Quality.hopRatio`), no longer from an fps threshold a 60 Hz display could never reach; `?quality=` holds
  the climb off. `?nomotioncalm` puts off what is now (08-12, the maintainer's call) the DEFAULT: Tab ▸ Frame / `__gimo.calm()` = the gi-motion lane's bundle (restirSpatialAll + restirPenRays + taauMotionAlpha 0.25 +
  taauSharpenMotion 0.15) that calms the DIRECT chain under camera motion at the price of contact-shadow softness — the maintainer's call (docs/internal/gi-motion.md). Since 08-11 `renderScale` is RELATIVE TO THE CAP: internal h = min(maxInternalHeight, cssH·dpr) × renderScale, so 1.0 =
  the preset's rows on any window tall enough and every step below it is real (`capScale`, `effectiveScale` = the true internal/css·dpr ratio for the cost model); render
  targets are pooled and temporal histories RESAMPLED across size changes (render/texpool.ts, `settings.keepHistories`), cascade instances parked per grid (`engine.rebuildRc` /
  `prewarmRc`). GPU cost: read the timer's UNION (`engine.timer.unionMs()`, HUD 'gpu ∪', recorder `gpuUnion`) — per-pass sums over-state a saturated frame by 35–55 %
  because independent compute passes overlap (docs/internal/p0a-cascades.md). `plan(gpuMs, fixedMs, preset, eff, cssH, dpr)` is the pure decision (exported; also
  `__quality.plan`); `bun run tools/qa/quality-plan.ts` prints the cost table and plan()'s picks for synthetic machines (M4 Max →
  high ×1.0, M1-class HiDPI → verylow, …) — re-run it after correcting REF/FACTOR from measured pass timings. Under automation set
  `window.__testVisible = true` or calibration/sampling wait forever on the hidden pane.
- **Auto lets sharp direct go before it shrinks the picture** (10-25, the maintainer's pick off his own takes: 'Auto drops it'; `settings.ladderShed`, on in the page, `?laddershed=0` or Tab ▸ Frame ▸ 'ladder: auto drops sharp direct before pixels' = the ladder as it was; `ui/quality.ts SHED`, the block above the constant is the rule in full). Sharp direct draws the g-buffer, the direct light and the composite at the OUTPUT size, so it is the one part of a frame a smaller render scale does not make cheaper: on his Mac at High ×0.5 it was 4.9 of 15.5 ms, High could not hold 60 in a fight even at the scale floor, and with it off he saw no difference. UNDER AUTO ONLY, wherever the ladder would take pixels off the tier's own picture (the cut by rate, the step for the back-off band, the cut taken with a load spike's rungs, an aim's judged cut on a display missing its vsync, a preset starved away) and sharp direct is drawing and the tier's to place (no `?sharp` / `?nosharp` / `?noiq`), it turns sharp direct off INSTEAD, with its two riders (the decoupled jitter, GBAA); rungs the climb had put on top of the tier's start still come off first. The shed stays across auto's preset hops (`hopRatio` prices the next preset without it) and ends with a pin, auto chosen again, or the switch. It comes back when the tier is at its own scale, the rate at the aim, no preset hop about to be taken, and the union PRICED WITH IT ON THE TIER'S OWN PICTURE clears the same 12.0 ms a restored scale step must, six windows running; no sooner than 60 s after it went, doubling each time it has to go again soon after coming back. Rungs the climb took while it was off are priced off and come off with that move: the tier's own row outranks the extras. ITS PRICE is the cost model's share, or what this machine's union showed if that is more (capped at 3× the model): off a shed, what the union gave back, trusted for twice the hold-off only (a spike that ended in that second reads as its price, and a reading nothing could test again would keep it off for the visit); on the way back, what the union took on in a calm scene, which replaces the other and stands 15 minutes. So a machine the model underprices tries it once after a fight, reads the price and leaves it. Where it does not fit the climb spends the room on pixels, to ×0.95. Put back on by hand (the Tab row) while shed, the ladder forgets its shed. The benchmark and the F8 sweep keep a standing shed across their own preset flips, and an F9 take begun mid-shed says so (`shedAtStart`), so the replay tool does not read it as a row put off by hand. A shed is JUDGED by the paced check like the cut it replaces: on a page something else holds to a low frame rate it buys nothing and goes back with the chain's pixels. Words in a take: `shed ↓ sharp direct off (…)` / `shed ↑ sharp direct back (…)` as `ladder` events, `__quality.shedState` in the console. NO `FROZEN_HOLDS` ROW and no knob table: the ladder exists only in the page (`main.ts` builds `Quality`), the headless Game has none on either stand, and nothing in the update reads `sharpDirect` (the one reader, `Game.viewPx`, sizes thin lines in the picture and already follows the render scale). The check: `bun run tools/qa/ladder-replay.ts --selftest` (26 lines of its 110; `LADDERSHED_BREAK=1` fails twenty; the same counts under `TPS_PROFILE=shipped`), and `--shed on|off [--sharpk N]` replays a take with the rule forced (a take from before the switch replays with it off). WHAT WAS MEASURED: nothing on a GPU. On paper, two of his Auto takes replayed with sharp direct priced as his sweep measured it (`--sharpk 2.2`): a 110 s fight that the page spent 88 % on Medium at a mean 582 rows stays on High at a mean 770 rows, at the aim 100 % of the time (98 % before); a 179 s take that spent 92 % on Low at 479 rows stays on Medium at 590. The replay is a response model, not a render. NOBODY HAS SEEN: the rule on a GPU at all; what a shed looks like at the moment it happens (the targets are re-made, as when the Tab row is flipped); the picture without sharp direct on Medium and Low, which no take or eye has compared. NOT COVERED, on purpose: a pinned preset keeps sharp direct whatever its frame rate (the pick was about Auto), and the boot's `plan()` still prices every tier with it on, so a machine that boots onto a lower preset is not offered the higher one without it.
- **One cache grid at every preset** (10-23; `settings.oneCacheGrid`, on in the page and the workbench, `?onegrid=0` puts it off; no Tab row). WHY: the light meter the
  guards and teammates see by (`probe.wgsl`) is the shadowed direct light plus the cache's dice read trilinearly at the asked point, so the probe lattice is part of the
  reading. low and verylow ran a coarser lattice (32 × 3 × 22 against 40 × 4 × 28) and read tight night shadow two to three times darker: sneaking was easier on the low
  presets, and the auto ladder moved the rule under a mission whenever it stepped between medium and low. WHAT: every preset's `rc` row is the one grid; low and verylow
  keep the old one as `rcCoarse`, and `rcGridOf(preset, one)` is the only reader (the preset put on, the grids parked at boot, the cost model: `presetCost(p, oneGrid)`,
  `costTable`, `plan(…, oneGrid)`), so off = the grids AND the ladder's prices as they were. With it on no preset step rebuilds or swaps the cache, and nothing is parked
  at boot. No `FROZEN_HOLDS` row and no journal line: nothing in a step reads it (the meter reaches the game through `Game.sensors`, and the headless stand-in has no cache).
  MEASURED on the software adapter (the pair mission at night, the meter asked at 11 fixed points at 0.8 m and 1.5 m, ten drawn frames, one run each; E, then the HUD's
  LIGHT): in the gap between the containers verylow 0.015 / 0.018 (LIGHT 0) on the coarse grid, 0.046 / 0.057 (13) on the one grid, high 0.049 / 0.063 (15); behind the
  low wall at 0.8 m 0.045 → 0.103 against high's 0.113; the road in shadow LIGHT 0 → 9 (high 9); the partner's start 0 → 6 (high 7); points in the moon 46 to 48 on all
  three. What is left between verylow and high is under 10 % at nine of the eleven points and 14 % at a tenth (0.017 against 0.020), verylow mostly the lower: its far
  field refreshes over more frames and ten had not settled it (inferred). The eleventh sits beside a standing man at 0.8 m: 0.117 on both verylow grids, 0.052 on high. Not the cache: `occluded()` tests a character's skinned mesh where the preset has mesh shadows (ultra, high near) and his
  capsules elsewhere, so the meter's direct light in a man's own shadow is still the preset's (read in the code, one point; the meter's owner's, not mended).
  NOT MENDED: the read itself. One lattice makes the presets agree; it does not make the meter right — it still blends the cells around the asked point, some of them
  inside the wall or the container beside it (the bullet on BOUNCE WALLS says the same of a lit room's wall). A read of the meter's own (its own short fan of rays from the
  asked point, the cache only at their hits) would take the lattice out of the reading at every preset and cost a few thousand rays a frame, but it moves every LIGHT
  number the levels were tuned on. PRICE: low and verylow trace 2.1 × the probes at their own refresh periods; in the cost model their fixed part goes 1.9 → 2.4 and
  1.4 → 1.9 model-ms (`quality-plan.ts`: an M1 / M2-base-class machine, 4.5 × the reference, boots at verylow ×0.50 where it had low ×0.50; a 5.5 × one no longer fits
  the budget at the floor), about +0.2 ms a frame on the reference machine by the cache's measured 1.05 ms at high and the level shares. NEVER TIMED ON A GPU, and never
  seen on one: what low and verylow look like on the finer cache is not known. CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ladder` (family `perf`; the ladder's self-test, which
  now runs the page's grid, with five lines of this rule; `ONEGRID_BREAK=1` fails four; both stands). `rfix-proofs.ts r101` (the parked-grid hop) boots with `&onegrid=0`
  so it still crosses grids; that edit was not run. Page tools that pin `?quality=verylow` on the software adapter now trace the finer cache too.
- **One smoke pressure solve at every preset** (10-23; `settings.oneSmokeSolve`, on in the page and the workbench, `?onesolve=0` = each preset's own `rbIters` as it was:
  ultra 5, high 4, medium, low and verylow 3; no Tab row beside the solver's own 'pressure: rb pairs' slider; render-side, so no game table, no journal line, no
  `FROZEN_HOLDS` row: the headless stands solve no smoke on a GPU). WHY: a sight line through smoke (`game/sensors.ts` → `probe.wgsl` kind 1) is the optical depth of the
  SOLVER's density, and the pressure pairs decide how a plume rolls and spreads. With the pairs a preset row, the cloud that hides a man had another shape at medium than at
  high, and the auto ladder changed it under a fight each time it stepped: a game rule reading the graphics setting, as the meter's cache grid was. Every preset now runs high's
  4 (`rbItersOf(preset, one)` in ui/quality.ts, asked where a preset is applied). PRICE, by reading only: one pair more (two dispatches over the live bricks) a solver step
  on medium, low and verylow, one fewer on ultra; the cost model does not price the solver, so the ladder's price for a step down no longer includes a cheaper solve. The one figure on record is the old
  box solver's on the maintainer's own machine: 0.044 ms a pair a domain (`docs/internal/smoke-perf.md` §1b). NOT MEASURED: how far a plume's shape moved between 3, 4 and 5 pairs, so how much
  sight ever differed; and the cost. NOT MADE ONE by this: the density a sight line reads is still the page's solver, and the headless stand-in is another model
  (`docs/agents/replays.md`). CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ladder`, three lines (`ONESOLVE_BREAK=1` fails one), both stands. PAGE (the software adapter, the final code, `?paused&quality=medium&mute`):
  booted with 4 pairs at medium; low, verylow and medium applied in turn each left 4; with the setting put off and the same three applied, 3 each; back on, 4; a canister solved
  six frames at `stats.rbPairs` 4 with no GPU or page error. The `?onesolve=0` word itself was not opened on a page (one line beside `?onegrid=0`, read before the first
  preset). Never timed or seen on a GPU.
- **The smoke keeps high's look down the ladder** (10-23; `settings.smokeKeep` 0 | 1 | 2, 1 in the page and the workbench, `?smokekeep=0|1|2`, Tab ▸ Frame 'smoke under
  high'). The maintainer, with auto on medium: "a ton of the smoke became very blocky … the smoke looks so sick in our game that i'd rather we keep it closer to high but
  then tradeoff other things in the frame budget". WHAT WAS BLOCKY: under high the march ran at quarter size (`lossy.volQuarter`: one march texel under 4 × 4 internal
  pixels; high's half-size march has 2 × 2), lit by fewer lights a step (medium 3 / 2, low and verylow 2 / 0 = `caps.volK` / `caps.marchLights`, high 4 / 3) and on low and
  verylow with a 2.0 step that combs a plume's shadow edges. WHAT 1 DOES: on medium and low the smoke's rows are the better of the rung's own and high's (`withSmoke(preset, keep)`
  in quality.ts: the march at half size, high's lights a step, shadow refresh and step length), on the preset's OWN path — the froxel haze stays, beams are not the smoke —
  and everything else the rung sheds is still shed (rays, reflections, mesh shadows, bounce cards, denoiser passes, the cache's refresh, the pixel count). The ladder pays
  the difference where it always does first: in render scale. 2 = high's whole volumetric path as well (`caps.vol` 'classic': the per-pixel march for haze AND smoke,
  high's 20 beam steps): the smoke exactly as high draws it at the rung's pixel count, there so the two can be compared by eye. 0 = every preset's own rows, as it was.
  verylow keeps its own smoke at every value (`smokeOwn` on its row): it is the floor, with no rung beneath it to pay, so the smoke is the LAST thing the ladder sheds.
  The solver's iterations (`rbIters`) are not a look row and this switch does not move them: ONE SMOKE SOLVE, the bullet above. high and ultra are the same rows at 0, 1 and 2. With 1 or 2 on, the climb's
  'volumetrics ¼ → ½' rung has nothing to do above verylow, and the caps bullet's medium and low rows below are what 0 runs. `withSmoke` is the only
  reader (the rows put on, the live preset, `costTable(oneGrid, smokeKeep)`, `plan`), so 0 is the ladder as it was, prices included; `Quality.resmoke()` is the Tab row's
  by-hand step. No `FROZEN_HOLDS` row and no journal line: nothing in a step reads it (smoke SIGHT lines are the solver's density, not the march).
  WHAT IT COSTS — on the maintainer's Mac at high in a fight with one dust cloud live (the F8 sweep of 10-10, three rounds; that take's pass was beams and smoke on the
  classic path): the march at quarter size gave back 0.5 to 0.9 ms (0.4 in a calm view with no cloud), 2 lights a step where there were 4 gave 1.5 to 1.65, the froxel path
  1.5 to 1.85 — against 2.3 ms for render scale ×0.77 → ×0.60 and about 7.6 ms for all of medium. So at 1 a rung under high is dearer by roughly a millisecond at high's
  pixel count in a smoky fight (less at its own, about one 0.05 step of render scale on that Mac — INFERRED from those rows, not timed), and at 2 by about 1.5 more. The
  cost model only knows the calm still (medium's per-pixel part 13.3 → 13.5 → 14.0 model-ms at 0 · 1 · 2; no synthetic machine of `quality-plan.ts` changes its pick).
  OTHER THINGS A RUNG COULD GIVE UP INSTEAD, with that Mac's rows at high: the cache at half rate 0.9 ms, mesh shadows 0.8 (medium has none already), audit rays 0.5,
  direct light at 3 rays 0.26, held-light rays at 2 0.25 to 0.38; the reflections' passes read 3.2 ms but the frame moved 0.14. None is taken: by eye, the maintainer's.
  At 2 the model prices medium a shade UNDER 1 (it drops the froxel term and knows no fight): a setting for the eye, not for auto's arithmetic.
  NEVER TIMED OR SEEN ON A GPU. CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ladder` (family `perf`; nine lines of this rule in the ladder's self-test; `SMOKEKEEP_BREAK=1` fails
  two; both stands).
- **Worst-case caps (renderer v3 Phase 0)** — the loud minute (QRF weapon lights + rain + a floor full of smoke + a firefight's particles) bounded with no look change
  at rest; every tier runs the same capped paths, scaled by `PRESETS[*].caps` in quality.ts (ultra 6/2/1.5 · 512, high 4/2/1.5 · 384 — both on the CLASSIC per-pixel path since 08-12, `Caps.vol` —, medium 3/2/1.5 · 256,
  low 2/2/2.0 · 192, verylow 2/2/2.0 · 128 = volK/volEvery/volStep · births): (1) `settings.volLightCap` K (`frame.volCfg.x`; **0 = the volumetric
  pass bit for bit as it was**, proven on the vol texture) — volumetrics.wgsl marches each of the smoke's BOUNDS' own stretch of the ray front to back at that lattice's step (its comments still say 'domain')
  (merged where they overlap) instead of the hull of all of them at the finest voxel, builds a per-stretch shortlist (exact culls: range, the 0.03 floor, cone, panel
  facing; ≤ 16 sorted by unshadowed bound — never 'every light'), gives a shadow ray + self-shadow to the first K lights that reach each step (refreshed every
  `volShadowEvery` steps = `volCfg.y`, reused between; march step `volStepVoxels` = `volCfg.z` tenths — 2.0+ combs shadow edges in a plume, low/verylow only), caches the
  ambient's wall test per dice cell; haze beams keep the K strongest per ray by unshadowed in-scatter (64-bit mask; kind-2 always). Tab ▸ Direct light ▸ CAP rows.
  (2) `settings.particleBirths` → `Particles.prepare(dt, on, cap)`: births a frame; records that do not fit WAIT in the queue (long-lived kinds first once anything
  waits, arrival order untouched otherwise; an oversize record is born alone; a spark record shed after `SPARK_MAX_WAIT` 6 frames; queue ≤ `MAX_QUEUE` 512) —
  `probes.ts particles-queue` holds the defer contract. (3) the smoke solver's cap is no longer a preset's: which bricks step is the pool's own rule on every tier (calm and far bricks wait: the smoke bullet); `Caps.smokeFull` /
  `fullRateDomains` went with the boxes. Measure with `tools/qa/stress-scene.js` (`await import('/qa/stress-scene.js')`
  → `__stress.setup()` / `.record(n)` / `.ab(applyA, applyB)` / `.caps(on)` / `.table(r)`, serialized frames, orbiting camera) and `__hotVol(src?)` (recompile
  volumetrics.wgsl from disk — the dev server serves src/render/shaders under /qa/shader/ — and swap the pipeline in without rebooting a staged scene).
- **Froxel volumetrics** (renderer v3 Phase 2b) — `settings.froxelVol` per tier (`quality.ts Caps.vol`: ultra / high 'classic', medium and below 'froxel'), `?nofroxel` / `?froxel` force either; `settings.smokeMarchLights`; `__froxel`, `__hotFroxel` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Lossy options** (engine settings, default OFF in `defaultSettings`, switched ON by the presets as above; pause menu *Graphics —
  trade-offs* + `LOSSY:` rows in the Tab panel for A/B): `settings.checkerDirect` (frame flag 65536: shadow rays on a checkerboard
  half per frame, direct.wgsl), `gatherThird` / `volQuarter` (gather at 1/3, volumetrics at 1/4 res: `passes.setDivisors`, divisors
  in `frame.lossyCfg.xy`), `rcHalfRate` (`rc.halfRate`: uppers even frames, c0 + bake odd), `dimRays` + `dimRaysBelow`
  (`frame.lossyCfg.z`: one emitter sample per leader under that unshadowed luminance). `engine.render` mirrors the booleans every
  frame, so they are the single source of truth. Off must stay the untouched path — A/B them one at a time (pin `?quality=ultra` AND set `settings.volLightCap = 0`
  — every preset, ultra included, carries the Phase 0 volumetric cap; `__stress.caps(false)` puts both caps back to the untouched paths).
- **ReSTIR DI = the direct-light estimator** (renderer v3 phase 2a) — `settings.restir` default ON, `?norestir` = direct.wgsl's leader / tail path; the hybrid held-light path `settings.heldRays`; the motion twin `settings.restirMotion`, `?norestirmotion`; `__hotRestir` / `__hotDirect`, debug views 11 / 12 — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **TAAU** (renderer v3 phase 1) — `settings.taau` default ON, `?notaau` = the old chain; `__taa`; RULE kept here: `frame.viewProj / invViewProj / prevViewProj` ARE the jittered matrices — never build a screen ray from `cam.*` on the GPU side — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Sharp direct** (decoupled resolution) — `settings.sharpDirect`, switched on per tier by `quality.ts Preset.iq`, `?sharp` / `?nosharp` force it; live only under TAAU below scale 1.0; `__sharp` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **The resolve configuration per tier** (image-quality program) — `quality.ts IqTier` on `Preset.iq` (sharp direct + decoupled jitter + GBAA + history de-blur), `?noiq` = the resolve as it was, `?gbaa`, `?nomv` (`settings.motionIds`); harness `__iq` — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.
- **Stratified gather directions + the trace lab** (ported from exp/trace-perf; the notebook is docs/internal/trace-perf.md, the page docs/review/trace-perf.html): `settings.gatherStrata`
  (default ON since 08-12 — the maintainer liked it; `?nogatherstrata` = the iid gather, `__gs {on, summary()}`, Tab ▸ Indirect light ▸ 'EXP: stratified gather directions') draws the final gather's k-th ray of four from
  STRATUM (k + frame) mod 4 of the cosine hemisphere (fgather.wgsl `cosineDirK`: azimuth half × cos²θ half; mainGi's two fresh rays a Latin square over the same cells; the young-history
  extras a complete stratified set of their own) instead of iid — UNBIASED (tile means within ±0.5 %, temporal sd equal or lower) but a whole 8×8 tile's k-th rays share a quarter of direction
  space and walk the grid coherently: gather 2.03 → 1.70 ms at high 1368×770 (−16 %), −0.8 ms at ultra. passes.ts compiles the gather module TWICE behind a prepended `const GATHER_STRATA`
  (`pFG/pFGR` false = the module exactly as it was, `__png`-hash-identical to main; `pFGs/pFGRs` true) and the encode picks the pair each frame, so it flips live; NOT hash-identical when on
  (a different sample pattern). THE TRACE LAB (`tools/qa/trace-lab.js` → `__tl`, kernels `src/render/shaders/trace_lab.wgsl` served from disk, `tools/qa/gpu-quiet.sh`):
  `?trace=N` → `render/frame.ts traceConfig` → `const TRACE_VARIANT` at the head of the scene prelude (only 0 = today's walk exists on main — the branch's V1‥V8 / H1 traversal variants were
  negative results and were not merged; a new experiment adds `…V<N>` copies of occluded / occludedT / traceClosest + three thin `switch (TRACE_VARIANT)` dispatchers and the lab finds them);
  `__hotCommon` / `__scenePrelude` / `__traceConfig` / `__commonSource` / `__daylight` in main.ts, `rc.hotSwap`, `particles.hotSwapSim`; `__tl.scene('B1'‥'B5') / points / bench / exact /
  profile / ab / aa / idHash / matrix` = Mrays/s of one ray class through one query per variant, bit-exactness counters, the reference walk's per-ray counters, interleaved frame A/Bs.
  THE GATHER'S BOUNCE READ IS BOUNDED (08-12, docs/internal/render-defects-0812.md §3, rig `tools/qa/rd-scenes.js`): every secondary-hit cache read in fgather.wgsl goes through
  `lighting_common diceIrradianceFrom(Ph, n, P0, N0)` — one probe spacing off the hit face like any dice read, but never past the plane of the surface the ray LEFT (P0, N0), and no trilinear
  neighbour from behind that plane (they collapse to the home cell) — the fix for indirect light 'leaking' behind the manager's shelves (the cartons' backs 12 cm off the wall read the lit
  storage room next door: 26–50 → 5); a new bounce read at a hit takes the receiver's plane the same way, never the bare `diceIrradiance(Ph + n·1 m)`.
- **The denoiser** (renderer v3 phase 3) — `settings.denoiser` `'v3'` default | `'legacy'`, `?legacydenoise`; one core (`render/shaders/denoise.wgsl`), three clients (shadow / diffuse / specular); `__dn`, `__hotDenoise`, debug view 13 — the full bullet moved word for word to `docs/internal/claude-md-renderer-systems.md`.

<!-- was CLAUDE.md lines 2979–3015 -->
- **Smoke = one pool of bricks** (THE smoke solver since 2026-10-10, no switch; the maintainer on the eight 64³ boxes it replaced: "let's just remove the box smoke if this is the way we want to do it" · "we can always revive from
  git history" — the last commit with both solvers is 1530281c, the pool there behind `?sparsesmoke`; notebook docs/internal/sparse-smoke.md, page docs/review/sparse-smoke.html; the names `smoke.sparse`, `SPG_* / spg*`, sparse-lab.js are the prototype's, kept):
  `src/smoke/smoke.ts SmokeSystem` + `smoke.wgsl` + `smokeGrid.ts`: the boxes' solver step on ONE level-wide lattice per voxel size (fine 2.2 cm gun gas, coarse 5.5 cm cans and dust) cut into 8³-cell
  BRICKS that exist only where smoke is (+ `ring` cells of air), one pool of 4096 (`?smokepool=N`, 256‥8192, read once at boot; `?sparsesmoke=N` still reads as that, bare it does nothing), page table / free list / live list / 27-neighbour tables all made on the GPU, 17 + 2 × pairs dispatches a step whatever the
  plume count; every reader goes through `shaders/smoke_read.wgsl`, appended to the scene prelude (r32uint page texture at scene binding 14 + an rgba16float atlas of 10³ blocks at 8; binding 7 = `array<SmokeBound, 8>`, GPU-made; binding 11 is free; shadow rays + the probe walk bricks, the view
  marches walk ≤ 4 bounds per level). No domain count, no faces, no edge fade, nothing for game code to count (`stats.live` = the pool in 512-brick units for the recorder's column; no rule reads it); the limit is total VOLUME (soft ceiling from 60 % of the pool, sooner and harder far from the camera's focus: `viewBias` / `viewR` round `engine.viewFocus`).
  WHAT WENT WITH THE BOXES: `pressure_half.wgsl`, `smoke_lab.wgsl` + tools/qa/smoke-lab.js (`__sl`), `dust_look_sparse.wgsl` (dust_look.wgsl is that text now), FrameFlags `SmokeRenderSkip` + `settings.smokeRenderSkip`, `Caps.smokeFull` / `fullRateDomains`, `CHAOS.puffDomains`, `SmokeSystemLike.unbounded`,
  seven Tab rows (CAP domains, both skip-empty-bricks, flush ε, pressure at half res, fine / coarse voxel).
  ROUND TWO (10-10, each a knob of `__smoke.sparse` and a row of
  Tab ▸ Volumetrics ▸ Smoke pool, each off = the pool as first benched at 3781d45; `__spl.asBenched()` = all off; notebook §9): WHO STEPS = per BRICK, a brick whose fastest air crosses ≤ `params.calmCells` cells (`farCells` 1 out of sight; 2 left nearly twice the smoke hanging at 7 s: a brick that steps less often loses less, notebook §9.1)
  waits 1 / 2 / 4 frames (`calmMax`; 1 = off) and then integrates what it sat out, never past `dtCap` 1/12 s, the shortest wait of its 27 neighbours, a source wakes what it reaches; the whole pool is dispatched directly from `directAt` of it
  stepping. READS HOP (`readSkip`, SHIPS OFF since the Mac's take: eight pairs, no time saved): shadow rays, the lit marches and the froxels skip stretches the page says are clear (`smokeClearRun` / `smokeAnyIn` over a macro map) — same samples, same answers. WHO GIVES WAY (`fresh` 0.15; 0 = first
  come): as the last 2 × fresh of the pool fills, what counts as thin rises, haze is refused the last slots, keeps less air and is let go sooner; nothing evicted, nothing for game code to count. WHAT IS IN A CELL: one word per
  coarse cell (share not canister smoke, 1 − tint) carried along the density's backtrace; `publish` lays `densityScale` / `fxDensityScale` and the tint into the atlas texel, so the two Tab rows act on smoke in the air (frozen too:
  `refreshDomains` → `publishAll`), every reader incl. the guards' probe takes the same `.x`, and the dust twin reads `shaders/dust_look.wgsl`. GUN GAS LETS GO (`fineDecay` 3 /s, `fineShare` 0.25; 0 and 1 = as benched; §9.8): a fine brick is a fifteenth of a coarse one's volume and nothing eats gun gas any more, so 1.7 s on AUTO
  held two thirds of the pool; now thin gas on the fine lattice and the heat in it fade faster, its floors are higher and its air ring smaller (`fineEps / fineHeat / fineRing`, live only while `fineDecay` > 0), and that lattice has a share of the pool that
  stretches to what the coarse one leaves under `softLo` (haze refused from 0.7 of it, all but sources at all of it; counted apart from a dry pool's refusals: `stats.fineHeld`). `tools/qa/sparse-reads.js` (`__spr.run()` = page loads / atlas fetches / march turns per ray hopping or not, `__spr.at(points)` = what a reader is handed). GPU time (the maintainer's Mac, 10-10, high 734 × 770, one run a solver; notebook §5, docs/perf/sparse-lab-*-mac-1010.json): solver ≈ 0.37 ms + 0.45 µs a brick, pool full 2.16 ms / +3.00 union against eight boxes' 2.83 / +3.68, one can in the open peaks at 2029 bricks = 1.31 ms, ≈ +1.5 ms of union over its box; the look: 'big plumes of smoke are sick' (the maintainer, the compound on hard, four cans). `tools/qa/sparse-lab.js` (`__spl.run()`, a fresh boot a run: 1 / 4 / 8 / 12 cans, then one can through its 32 s burn) is the bench; `__spl.round2()` flips each round-two lever in place on five standing scenes, then stages the dry pool, then a magazine on AUTO with the gun-gas rule and without. `__smoke.sparse` = its knobs. Round two on his Mac (10-10, notebook §9.7, docs/perf/sparse-lab2-*-mac-1010.json): solver 0.43 ms + 0.39 µs a brick that STEPS, twelve cans 1.66–1.70 ms / +2.2 to +2.6 union (round one 2.16 / +3.00), a can late in its burn 0.98–1.05 (1.25–1.31); 8192 = 81 % more smoke for +3.85 to +4.02 and 255.5 MiB, so the pool stays 4096; four cans at once already sit on the soft ceiling (~3,150 bricks). A solver-only run on a page that
  has rendered a frame still carries that frame's WIND records (`smoke.setWind([], 3)` first).
- **Prototype branches — NOT merged** (as of August, except the particle rain: `game/rainFx.ts`, `?prain`, `settings.particleRain` default off and the Frame's 832 B ARE in the build now; fire and water are still not in `src/`; each in its worktree with its own dev server; flag absent = main hash for hash, proven in its notebook; review page published as an Artifact):

<!-- added 2026-10-13, after the cut -->
- **Wet ground breaks up into pools and damp aggregate** (`settings.wetBreakup` 0‥1, default 1; `?nowetbreak` = 0 = the frame as it was; Tab ▸ Materials ▸ '· wet ground break-up'; the small flaws
  goal, commit 2a41e5b5; PICTURE ONLY): under the storm every open ground slab took one finish (roughness 0.22, stretched), which the reflection pass drew as a near mirror across the view. The
  g-buffer now varies that roughness over the ground in world space (`detail.wgsl wetGround`, read in gbuffer.wgsl whatever the detail layer's amount): about +0.04 in the low spots, +0.15 on the
  stone between them. Dry gloss floors are untouched. The amount rides `frame.rtCfg.z` as the anisotropy + 2 × tenths (reflect.wgsl / reflect_p5.wgsl take the anisotropy back out: keep the two
  in step). The sender's claim, not re-checked here: seen only on the software adapter.
- **Lasers and tracers show in the ray-traced reflections** (`settings.beamReflect`, default on, acts only with `rtReflect`; `?nobeamreflect` = no segment handed over, the pass's frame as it
  was; Tab ▸ Materials ▸ '· lasers & tracers in reflections'; the small flaws goal, commit 29dd44b8; PICTURE ONLY): a beam is a NoShadow box no ray can meet, so the reflection pass never saw
  one. `engine.ts` hands `passes.setBeams(world.dynamics, thinIs, viewFocus)` the frame's thin lines (the boxes `game/thinline.ts thinNote` noted: combat.ts `beamBoxes`, tracers.ts) as line
  segments — up to eight, nearest the view — in a small UNIFORM at the reflection pass's binding 11 (not a storage buffer: the scene group's budget is untouched), and reflect.wgsl /
  reflect_p5.wgsl add each one's image where the mirror ray passes it, behind one occlusion ray. No beam on the frame = a zero count = nothing added. A beam is still never a light and still
  in nobody's eye or meter (the one-model rule of the IR lasers bullet stands).
- **Squad lasers are light in the air** (`settings.beamAir`, PICTURE ONLY, default ON; `?nobeamair` / Tab '· squad lasers as light in the air' = the glowing boxes exactly as before; debug views show the
  boxes; the maintainer, 10-13, floodlit at night in rain under the tube: "the lasers do feel a bit nonphysical", then "it's a bit bright given the brightness of the IR beam"). Cause: a laser was an
  emissive BOX floored at a pixel wide, which the tube's log curve clips to white: every beam one flat 4 px white bar end to end, its 2 cm bead lost in it, blind to rain and smoke. The game's boxes
  are untouched (`thinline.ts thinAir` marks a weapon laser's line and its bead; `passes.ts setBeams` hides them from the primary view through `BoxWorld.hidePrimary` and hands ≤ 8 segments to
  composite group 1 binding 15); `composite.wgsl beamAir` adds a Gaussian line (σ = max(2.2 mm, 0.55 px)) of the beam's light × an AIR SHARE, a dot where it lands (gain 3.5, r 9 mm, halo 0.07,
  not scaled by the air) and a glint at the emitter. Air share = `beamAirK` × (0.03 + 0.09 × haze/0.035, haze capped at 2×) = 0.12 by default, + 0.25 × rain and a sparkle on drops outdoors, + up
  to 3 in smoke (read per pixel). A line whose far end is under the ground is cut AT the ground and given its dot (the game's `laserReach` does not meet the yard's floor: such a beam had no dot
  in either look; the IR laser's owner's, not mended in the game). No `FROZEN_HOLDS` row and no journal line: nothing in a step reads it. MEASURED on the software adapter (SwiftShader, verylow,
  floodlit's storm, tube on, 5 lasers, live flips on one page): boxes = core 255, +79 over the wet ground, 94 % of the line ≥ 250; air share 0.565 (the first cut) = the same level, 69 % ≥ 250; air
  share 0.265 (about what ships in that rain) = peak 226, +54, 9 % ≥ 250 (the sparkle beads), dot 10–12 px at half height against a 2 px line. Pipelines 112/112, 0 GPU errors at verylow and high.
  NOT measured: clear air (estimate +25–40), the red visible beam, a beam across a depth edge, ultra / medium, motion (the sparkle's flicker). Never seen on a GPU: the maintainer's to judge.
- **Wet ground mirrors alike at every tier; a laser's mirror image follows the beam** (`settings.wetMirror`, PICTURE ONLY, default ON; `?nowetmirror` / Tab '· wet ground mirrors the men'; the
  maintainer, same shot: "we don't really see reflections of the characters"). Men ARE in the traced reflections (round-cone proxies in `traceClosest`, shaded with direct light and a shadow ray,
  the first 8 men only: `BoxWorld.addCharacterCapsules`), but `reflect.wgsl` gave the wet lot a dry finish's Fresnel (4 % from this camera) where the gloss path of low / verylow multiplies it by
  (1 + 2.5 × wetness) × 0.85, and the laser's image had a floor of its own (35 % × 1.5): a bright beam image beside men too faint to read. Now traced hits on `aniso` (wet) ground take
  min(F × (1 + 2 × wetness), 1) (the lamps' analytic glints are as they were), `beams.k.y` carries the 2 (0 = off: the arithmetic as it was), and an air-look laser mirrors at
  max(that, `BEAM_REFL_AIR` 0.25) × its air share, gain 1. KEEP IN STEP: reflect.wgsl ≡ reflect_p5.wgsl. MEASURED (SwiftShader, high, 6–12 frames of history only, 115–140 s a frame): the old
  beam image +11 over ground, the new one at the ground's own noise; NO man-shaped image readable with the switch on or off. So the men are 3× stronger than they were and still faint under
  the tube: dark wet kit (albedo 0.12) × 12 % against lit ground, then the log curve. Making them READ needs a drawn floor like the laser's had (a taste call, put to the maintainer), not
  more physics. Defenders past the 8-proxy table have no image and no shadow at all (a separate, bigger job). Never seen on a GPU.
- **The scene group's binding 11 is the fog of war's sight table, and `evalLight` asks it (10-14, `FOG.full` — `stealth.md`).** `common.wgsl`: `evalLight` =
  `evalLightRaw` (the old body) × `lightFogK` for a light whose kind word carries bit 25 / 26 (none while the rule or the fog is off: one `and` a light);
  `evalLightTrue` = the light as it is, for the game's readings (`probe.wgsl` alone). A NEW PLACE THAT WORKS A LIGHT OUT WITHOUT `evalLight` MUST MULTIPLY BY
  `lightFogK` (today: the glints in `reflect.wgsl` ≡ `reflect_p5.wgsl`, `cards.wgsl`, `froxel.wgsl`, the march's K-beam pick) — `probes.ts fog-full` reads the
  text for these and fails on any other file calling `evalLightRaw`. `fogSeenAt` walks the grid, so the VERTEX stage uses `fogSeenBins`. The table is a 58 KB (41 KB until 10-24, when the fog took five eyes; `FOG.eyes`, `docs/agents/stealth.md`)
  uniform (the 5th of 12 a stage may bind with the composite group's) written as storage by `fogsight.wgsl` at the head of the frame, bound through a second
  scene group (`sceneBGPlain`, a zero stand-in at 11). Sampled textures: the composite stage is at 15 of 16 (13 + the smoke atlas + the smoke page — the note
  at `passes.ts lComp` still says 14). Compiles on the software adapter (105 programs, 0 failed); never run on a GPU.

- **A shader module's text is cut to what it uses (2026-10-19, a play test: fifteen seconds and more of shader compiles on a fast Windows machine, "compiling the same shaders over
  and over", hitches while it does).** `src/gpu/wgslTrim.ts SHADER_TRIM` (ON; `?shadertrim=0` = every module whole, as it was — a switch of the page, not a rule of the game: no knob,
  no `FROZEN_HOLDS` row, both stands boot the same Engine). Every scene module is compiled behind `render/frame.ts scenePrelude()` — some 150 KB and 350 declarations in front of a
  kernel that may read a twentieth of it — and the head of that prelude holds the level's compile-time switches (the weather kinds, snow, the glass, the cut boxes), so a level of
  another family changed the TEXT of every module though most kernels never read the switch. `gpu/device.ts makeShader` (and the one boot module `passes.ts` makes itself, the dust
  volume's) now hands the browser `shaderText(code)`: the module-scope declarations an entry point reaches by name, in their order and character for character (comments aside);
  every entry point, `override`, directive and `const_assert` always stays, and text with no entry point comes back whole. Hot-swap and viewer modules are left whole.
  **Counted** (`tools/qa/shader-count-page.cjs`, the real page on the software adapter at medium, a walk of five pages: the title, the compound's kit picture, the compound, the
  block, the pass): the title is 66 modules, 12.1 MB of WGSL before and 3.3 MB after (73 % less); the same 150 pipelines either way (130 asynchronous + the three radiance-cascade
  ones before ready, 17 after), 118 of 118 counted in by the card, none failed, no GPU error on the console of any page. Module texts NEW to the browser on each page of the walk
  (not made, character for character, by an earlier page), before → after: the title 64 → 63 · the kit picture of a first mission 57 of 64 → 26 of 63 · that mission 2 → 2 · a
  second level of its family 0 → 0 · a snow level 58 of 66 → 13 of 65. Pipelines whose every stage an earlier page had made: 39 of 142 → 104 of 142 for the first mission, 41 of
  146 → 129 of 146 for the snow level. What still differs is what really reads a switch: thirteen modules read `WX_KINDS` (the title's office is the one family with it off), six
  to thirteen the snow's, one carries the level's own mesh-tree sizes. A quality change (medium → high on the title) made no module and no pipeline in the six seconds watched.
  `tools/qa/shadertrim-check.ts` (the Engine booted on a recording stand-in, whole and cut: same modules, order kept, every root kept, nothing left that mentions a dropped name,
  cutting twice changes nothing; a level whose weather switch differs is 10 new texts of 35 where it was 30; `SHADERTRIM_BREAK=1` must fail) — one Engine, so one stand's worth; it
  passes under `TPS_PROFILE=shipped` the same. `window.__boot.shaderText {modules, before, after, ms}` and `.slowest` (the six boot pipelines that came back last) are on the boot
  line; the benchmark's text carries them under `load`, with a `loads` row of every scene's own load (the first compiles cold, the later ones show what the browser kept).
  **The picture, cut against whole** (`tools/qa/draw-equal.cjs` on one build, the switch passed through its quality word: `--quality 'medium&shadertrim=0'`; 320×180, medium, the
  software adapter): the rain view and the squad view are EQUAL pixel for pixel at both checkpoints. One trap in reading it: the fog-of-war pass makes its pipeline on first use,
  so on the squad view the second drawn frame has that pass or not by how fast the compile came back (one cut run had it, a second cut run and the whole run did not: those two
  are equal); `&nofow` on both sides takes the race out, and is equal at both checkpoints.
  **Never seen on a GPU.** That a driver's compile gets shorter, that the browser's shader cache now answers a second level's modules, and that the hitches go with the text are INFERENCES — the next
  benchmark text from the Windows machine is the measure (`load`, `loads`, `longest freeze`).
- **How big each kernel is once every call is pasted into its caller: `bun run tools/qa/shaderinline-check.ts [--top N] [--kernel <module>/<entry>] [--json f]` (2026-10-26).**
  Chrome on Windows compiles a pipeline's WGSL through DXC, which pastes every call into its caller before it optimizes, so a kernel pays for each CALL SITE of a heavy
  function, not for the text its module was handed. The tool makes that a number with no browser and no Windows machine: the page's boot run over a recording stand-in
  device (the Engine, the smoke solver, the Game's mesh shadows / particles / light probe / skinned raster, then `cutSwap.build()`; the shipped stand, cut boxes, the
  glass fracture and the dust twin on, as a plain address opens), every `createShaderModule` text and every pipeline descriptor kept, and each distinct (module text,
  entry point) sized by `pasted(f) = f's own text + for each call site in f, pasted(the callee)` in KB of WGSL as `wgslTrim.ts wgslDecls` reads it (comments out). It
  prints every kernel biggest first (pasted, the same functions once each, the ratio, boot or cut set, the functions pasted most into it), the totals of the two
  sets, the functions pasted most over all kernels, and the entry points nobody asked a pipeline for; `--kernel fgather/main` lists every function in one kernel with
  what ONE call site of it costs. Nothing in `src/` changed; no switch. **Today's kernels** (the same texts at 13164d24 and at the head this was written on): 64
  modules, 144 pipelines (119 the boot's — the card's 118 and the dust twin — and 25 the cut set's), 127 kernels; the boot's set is 13.1 MB pasted where 1.9 MB is each function once (×7.0), the cut set
  12.1 MB, both 25.2 MB. Biggest: the four composites 978 KB each (`gpHash` ×766, `fireHu` ×384), `fgather` `mainGi` 842, `main` 780 (62 KB once, its module 92 KB;
  `occluded` ×16 and `occludedTBoxes` ×15, the two counts the Windows measure named — its "~680 KB from 95 KB" was read another way and is not this tool's number),
  the dust twin 715, the volumetric march 667, `reflectP5` 639, the particle update 585, direct 405, restir 347. Over all kernels: `isectBox` ×1462 copies (1.9 MB),
  `gpHash` ×7268 (1.6 MB), `isectCut` 1.2 MB, `occludedTBoxes` ×389 (1.0 MB), `occluded` ×284 (0.8 MB). **On the tree with the one-call-site rewrites** (the
  Windows pull request's head, 71a73c1c; the tool copied into a checkout of it): the boot's set 13.1 → 8.2 MB (×0.63), the cut set 12.1 → 7.3, both 25.2 → 15.5.
  Per kernel, pasted KB before → after, beside that tree's own offline DXC times: `fgather` `main` 780 → 228 (×0.29; DXC 7725 → 2223 ms, ×0.29) · `mainGi` 842 →
  294 (×0.35; ×0.40) · `reflectP5` 639 → 243 (×0.38; ×0.34) · composite 978 → 574 (×0.59; ×0.65) · direct 405 → 260 (×0.64; ×0.63) · particle update 585 → 361
  (×0.62; ×0.62) · restir 347 → 308 (×0.89; ×0.89) · reflect 274 → 199 (×0.73; ×0.79) · sharpUE 222 → 126 (×0.57; ×0.58) · the volumetric march 667 → 455 (×0.68;
  DXC ×0.30) and its dust twin 715 → 503 (×0.70; ×0.46). So the pasted size tracks what DXC took out of a kernel within a few points, except the two marches,
  where the rewrite turned repeated statements into turns of a loop and DXC gained more than the text did. That tree's boot going 26 s → 9 s is more than its text:
  its LATER twins leave the boot's wait too, and this tool counts a pipeline in the set it was ASKED in, not when a queue hands it to the browser. **Held against
  the real page** (`shader-count-page.cjs --json`, the title on the software adapter at medium, its text hashes beside this tool's `--json`): 62 of the page's 65
  module texts are this tool's character for character; the page also makes the outline's and the save picture's small modules (first use, no tracing), and the one
  mesh-shadow module differs (it carries the character mesh's own sizes); the page asked 146 pipelines, 118 of them counted by the card, this tool 144. **The
  budget** (the table at the head of the file): each kernel over 200 KB has its own row within a twentieth of today, every other kernel 200 KB; red names the
  kernel and both numbers. A kernel that grows on purpose has its row raised in the same change, a new big kernel gets a row, a row with a twentieth to spare is
  printed to be lowered, and a row no kernel answers to is red — on the rewrites' tree it is red for the one new kernel (`volumetricsF / main`, 455 KB, no row) and
  names eleven rows to lower, which is the edit that tree's landing owes this file. (That tree's kernels are in this one as the row Compact shaders, below: `TPS_COMPACTSHADERS=1` in front sizes them against a second table of their own, `BUDGET_COMPACT`, and today's rows stand as they are.) A second line is red when the recording is short of a boot (under 60 modules,
  118 boot pipelines or 24 of the cut set's), so a part of the page that falls out of the stand-in's boot cannot leave the budget green on the rest. `SHADERINLINE_BREAK=1` writes one more call site into the biggest kernel, of the lightest function it reaches whose
  call site is a twentieth of it (today `fireAir`, 76 KB, into `compositeS / cs`: 1054 of 1010 KB): FAILS, as it must (it would not while that row had a
  twentieth to spare, and the plain run names such a row). Two seconds a run; `typecheck:qa` clean. The boot it runs is main.ts's by hand (the six inits, the
  switches a plain address writes before the Engine): a GPU module main.ts gains is not sized until it is added here — the page's hashes are the check on that.
  **What it is not**: a time (DXC's grows faster than the text; a loop round one call site is one copy here, as there, whatever the loop's body costs); a list for
  another level (a snow level or a picked weather turns consts in the prelude: other texts, never sized here); a count of first-use pipelines made after the boot.
  **Nobody has run it beside a Windows compile of the same tree**: the agreement above is with the times the pull request's own notes give.
- **What is left of the shader wait, and needs a GPU to do (2026-10-19).** (1) Compile first what the opened quality draws (2026-10-26: the twins no first frame draws are LATER — the Windows bullets below): the boot waited for all ~133 pipelines though a tier
  takes a part of them (the legacy and v3 denoiser chains, every à-trous variant, both composite kinds are all made). The count tool prints which boot pipelines a pass took in the
  seconds after ready, but on the software adapter a frame is half a minute, so its list is a floor, not the set — the split needs a machine that draws, and every pipeline left
  for later needs its pass to stand down until it is in. (2) Module creation is one burst: sixty `createShaderModule` calls in one task, parsed back to back on the browser's GPU
  thread (the likely "longest freeze" of the benchmark's load row; the cut makes that burst a quarter of the text); spreading them over frames means an `await` between passes in
  `Engine.init`. (3) `render/rc.ts rebuildRc` makes its three pipelines synchronously at boot and at every quality change (identical text: the implementation's cache answers a
  repeat). (4) The Game's own build is one block of the page's thread (0.9 s here in the browser): the mesh shadows' BVH and the reach derivation are most of it
  (`render/meshShadows.ts`, `game/reach.ts`), with `math/hyp.ts`'s trial at module load beside them; the benchmark's `game built in` says what it is on a real machine.
- **Windows: why the shader wait came back on every load, and the compile queue (2026-10-26, measured on a Windows machine: RTX 3080, a 16-thread desktop CPU,
  Chrome 155, a 4K 240 Hz display at 150 %).** Chrome on Windows runs WebGPU on D3D12 and compiles with DXC (`use_dxc` is on; FXC, `--disable-dawn-features=use_dxc`,
  had not finished the boot after 16 minutes). DXC inlines every call, so the big kernels are 5–25 s each (fgather's `main` grows from 95 KB of WGSL to ~680 KB inlined:
  `occluded` ×16, the fog's `occludedTBoxes` ×15 through `evalLight`): 118 s of compiles for the title's boot one at a time, 26 s on the card (15 workers), the
  compound and the pass 30–60 s. (1) **Chrome's cache never answers it.** The compiled blobs ARE written to disk (`DawnWebGPUCache`, ~44 MB for the title), but the GPU
  process keeps them in an in-memory LRU of 6 MB (`DawnCachingInterface` → `GetDefaultGpuDiskCacheSize`, `kDefaultMaxProgramCacheMemoryBytes`), so the set thrashes it:
  a trace of a warm load showed 131 DXC compiles and 12 cache hits, and a reload in the same tab took as long as the first load. `--gpu-disk-cache-size-kb` raises the
  size but is not passed to the GPU process; with `--in-process-gpu` it is read, and a warm load is 1.5–2.3 s to interactive (pipelines 0.7–1.2 s) against 26–60 s.
  The game ships no launcher and asks for no switches: plain Chrome is what it is played and measured in, so those two words are a measuring aid only. On a Mac the same 6 MB thrash happens, but the Metal compiler is fast and keeps its
  own cache. `d3d_disable_ieee_strictness`, `disable_robustness` and `d3d_skip_shader_optimizations` change nothing worth having (the GPU union within 0.2 ms; skipped
  optimizations make DXC slower, 43 s). (2) **The burst starved the browser's own drawing.** Chrome makes every …Async pipeline on one worker pool in the GPU process,
  and Skia Graphite (the page's HTML: HUD, cards) makes its pipelines on the same pool. The cut-box set compiling after the boot held all 15 workers for 10–25 s, Graphite's
  pipelines asked for meanwhile waited behind it, and the raster's flush blocked (traces: 3.1 s, 6.7 s; a 15 s frozen picture in one take; the fog pass's own first-use
  pipelines waited too). `gpu/device.ts PIPE_QUEUE` (a switch of the page, ON ONLY IN A BROWSER ON WINDOWS, where it was measured: `?pipequeue=0` = straight to the browser as before,
  `?pipequeue=1` = on wherever the page is, which is how a Mac or a page tool tries it; no knob, every stand compiles the same programs): at most threads − 2 in flight at boot, biggest module first; after the boot (`pipeQueue.settle()`, main.ts) at most 4, of them at most 2 of the background
  set (modules behind `const CUT_BOXES: bool = true;`), the foreground first. **Measured** (`?bench`'s first floor, plain Chrome, cold, full screen at 4K, 40 s from
  interactive, presented frames from the trace's `Display::DrawAndSwap`): without the queue 69.6 frames/s presented, the longest gap 3.5 s, 11 gaps over 50 ms; with it
  76.5/s, the longest 163 ms, 5 over 50 ms; boot 32.5 → 30.3 s (one run each, a second pair agreed: a 3.6 s freeze → 133 ms). With those two switches (not shipped), warm, with the queue: boot
  1.6 s, 76.9/s, the longest gap 130 ms. The frame itself is the GPU's on that floor (union 13–18 ms at `high`, the ladder down to scale 0.5; `low` pinned: 9.9 ms,
  97 fps); the calm office at high is 10.6 ms at 1507×780, about the M4 Max reference above. Never measured on a Mac with the queue on (the boot order changes there too), which is why a Mac does not get it. On the software adapter the page tools run on, with the queue on, the boot made the same 146 pipelines with no GPU error (118 of 118 awaited), but the background set was not ready 21 minutes after the page was, where with the queue off it was ready 389 s after (one run each): two at a time is far slower there, and six page tools wait for that set. **The check**:
  `bun run tools/qa/pipequeue-check.ts` (the queue's own logic over a stand-in device, no browser: the limits, biggest first, the background cap, a failed, thrown
  or broken creation gives its slot back; where it is on is one pure function, `pipeQueueFor`; `PIPEQUEUE_BREAK=1` fails twenty-one, with the later lane's lines below, the same on both stands). A pipeline's time in `pipelineProgress.times` (the boot
  line's and the benchmark's "slowest") is counted from its turn in the queue, not from the asking, or biggest-first would name the smallest shaders the slowest.
  Read in Chrome's and Dawn's source the same day (not run): the 6 MB is one cache for a whole Chrome profile, every site together, oldest out first; on D3D12
  both the DXC bytecode of each stage and the finished pipeline's blob go into it; on Metal only the generated MSL text does, and the compiled pipelines are kept by
  the system's own Metal cache outside Chrome's 6 MB, which is why a Mac's second load is cheap. **Known, left as they are:** the cut-box set is ready later than it
  was (two at a time), so a wall cut in the first seconds draws whole for longer; the Team & kit picture is a second page with a queue of its own, at its boot limit
  while the menu is up, so that step can still freeze on Windows; a 4-thread machine's limits (4 and 4) are no smaller than its pool; `?cutprograms=boot` marks the
  live set background (the text sniff); the workbench never calls `settle()` and stays at the boot limit; `__hotCommon`'s build ms includes the wait in the queue.
- **Windows: the cold compile cut from ~26–30 s to ~9 s (2026-10-26, the same Windows machine; Chrome 155, D3D12, DXC 1.9.2607 as Chrome ships it) — BOTH LEVERS ARE ROWS ON
  TRIAL NOW, OFF BY DEFAULT (the next bullet): every number here is with both on, on the tree they were written in.** Measured with a
  browser already started (a fresh profile's first navigation waits 2.5–4.6 s on the browser's own start-up before it asks for the page: not the page's) and an EMPTY shader
  cache, `__boot` to interactive, cold every time: the title 26.0–26.5 s → 8.4–10.4 s (pipelines 25.0–25.4 → 7.4–9.4 s; four runs of the final build's shaders), the
  compound's room clear 29.4–29.7 → 8.6–8.7 s (three each), the pass (snow) 29.9–30.0 → 9.8 s (two each; one run in four of the same build takes a few seconds more — the
  GPU process's own scheduling).
  **Why it was slow**: DXC inlines every call into one function before it optimizes, so a kernel pays
  for each CALL SITE of a heavy function (the tracer, `occluded`, `evalLight` with the fog's walk) — fgather's `main` reached ~680 KB of inlined text from 95 KB of WGSL —
  and its time grows faster than the text. A small loop round a heavy call is NOT unrolled (tried: an opaque trip count changed nothing), so a loop of turns round ONE call
  site is the tool. **Two levers**: (1) THE ONE-CALL-SITE REWRITES, each the old statements in the old order (the same `rnd()` draws), so the picture is the same
  bits: fgather `main` and `mainGi` trace every ray (the gather's, the young tile's extras, the fresh candidates, the gloss floor's and the pane's mirror) through one
  `traceShade` in a loop of turns; `directAtPoint` / `directOnScreen` are one `directAt` with one `evalLight` and one `occluded` (also reflectP5's two-part hit and
  `giReshadeDirect`); reflectP5 takes the two halves and `traceClosestMesh` on every path (bit for bit `traceClosest` with its bits down); the volumetric rain walks its
  open-air pieces through one `rainAlong`, the sun and a lamp share one beam march, the fog's three looks and the sun's two rays are turns; the composite runs its beams /
  fire / volumetrics / veil tail once for sky and surface and the glass cracks draw one line list through one `gbEdge` (max / min only, so order-free); the particle update's
  three light walks are one `pLight`, and the drop's crown and head, the snow grain and the wisp share one `rainShadeV`; the direct pass's leaders and tail, the sharp
  pass's edge and sliver rays, restir's glass and target reads, the rig normal's four taps likewise. (2) LATER TWINS (`gpu/device.ts laterPipelineAsync`,
  `PIPE_QUEUE.later`, the row Start on first frame shaders; off = the boot waits for every one as before; a switch of the page, no knob): the boot's set leaves out what no first frame draws with the
  default settings — restir's motion twin (restir meanwhile), the iid gathers and the resampling pair (the strata pair / the plain gather meanwhile; the reservoirs start clean
  as when the row is switched on), reflectP5 (main's reflections), the old direct estimator (restir), the dust twin (plain smoke), the fragment composites (sharp direct is
  held live until one is in — engine.render, even at scale 1), the non-refracting compute composite (compSR, the same picture with no pane crossed), the froxel kernels and
  the volumetric pass's froxel twin (FrameFlags.FroxelVol held down: the per-pixel march meanwhile) — and compiles them after it in the queue's background lane; each lands
  through its cut set's `patch`. The K = 0 smoke march, which no preset runs, lives only in a twin built the first frame `volLightCap` is 0 (`volumetrics.wgsl VOL_K0`).
  **Offline DXC, per kernel, the title's text (ms, one at a time; HLSL dumped from Chrome with `dump_shaders`, timed with Chrome's own dxcompiler.dll)**: volDust 9268 → 4274,
  fgatherGi 9079 → 3658, vol 8626 → 2560 (+ the froxel twin), fgather 7725 → 2223, reflectP5 7396 → 2514, compositeS/SR 5265 → 3400, direct 4072 → 2579, particlesUpdate
  3488 → 2164 (the pass's 5914 → 3678), restir 3181 → 2847, reflect 2422 → 1906, sharpUE 1734 → 1009; the queue's 15 workers get ~4.5× out of the 16 threads (DXC alone
  scales 6× at best), so the boot is about its set's total ÷ 4.5. **The picture** (a GPU twin of `tools/qa/draw-equal.cjs`: its five views, plus the pass and the compound on
  their own camera, with `&cutprograms=boot` so the cut rule is in every program, every LATER twin waited for): EQUAL pixel for pixel on D3D12 against the tree before at
  high (all seven), medium (the five) and ultra (the five and the compound); the pass's second checkpoint at ultra differs only through the frames drawn before the twins
  landed (the resampling gather's reservoirs start clean when its twin lands, where the tree before carried the boot frame's) and is EQUAL with every twin waited for. A check WITHOUT `cutprograms=boot` must not wait for the queue: the cut set landing mid-capture changes the firefight view by design. **The
  frame** (the compound's room clear at ultra, scale 0.75, warm): union 13.65 → 13.85 ms (gather 1.37 → 1.50, compS 0.55 → 0.66; the loops' registers). **Not seen**:
  any of it on Metal (the rewrites are the same operations, but a fast-math compiler may schedule them to last-bit differences, as reflect_p5.wgsl's history notes), and the
  fallback frames themselves (a `?nogatherstrata` / `?norestir` / `?norefract` visit, ultra's phase-5 pair, a froxel tier, scale 1 — for the seconds before their twin is in).
  Left: vol's two smoke marches (the classic and the froxel-lit one are one march apart from their light — ~1.2 s of each program), the rain splash's second `rainLight`,
  restir's two `traceSample`s across its barriers, and the page script's own ~0.7 s.
  **A row to try (same day, off by default):** Options > Graphics > Shaders "Wall cut shaders when needed" (`?cutwhenneeded=1`) does not build the cut-box set at
  the start at all, only when a wall is first cut or a shot says one is coming — `destruction.md`, *WHEN NEEDED*, has the rule, the trade and the checks.
- **Shader rows on trial: Compact shaders and Start on first frame shaders (2026-10-26; Options > Graphics > Shaders, `src/ui/shaderrows.ts`).** The two levers of the
  bullet above, each a row that is OFF by default and is the NEXT load's (read once, when its module is imported: the pipelines are made before a menu can open). Kept
  under `twopointsix.shaderrows`; a URL word wins for the visit and is never written; a row is listed only in a build whose code reads it (`useShaderRow`). Switches of
  the page, not rules of the game: no knob, no `FROZEN_HOLDS` row, off on BOTH stands; the harness's words are `TPS_COMPACTSHADERS=1` / `TPS_FIRSTFRAME=1` in front of
  any headless tool. A third row, Wall cut shaders when needed (`?cutwhenneeded=1`), is the cut set's own (render/cutSwap.ts).
  **Compact shaders (`?compactshaders=1`, `render/kernels.ts`)**: TEN KERNELS EXIST TWICE. `src/render/shaders/compact/` holds fgather, gather_common, reflect_p5,
  volumetrics, composite, particles, direct, sharp_direct, restir and sdfrig written a second way BY HAND (one call site per heavy function; no tool makes a twin from
  its original), and `KERNELS` hands passes.ts, particles.ts and frame.ts one set or the other. With the row off nothing of the second set reaches the browser. The
  compact volumetrics.wgsl alone needs TypeScript the other does not, behind `COMPACT.on` in passes.ts: its two programs (`const VOL_FROXEL_MARCH`: 'vol' false,
  'volFroxel' true) and the K = 0 twin (`const VOL_K0`, 'volK0', built the first frame `volLightCap` is 0). **THE SECOND COPY IS A PROTOTYPE: one set goes when the
  default is decided.** Until then a change to one of the ten is made in BOTH files, or the row draws the picture as it was before the change:
  `git diff <before> <after> -- src/render/shaders/<k>.wgsl | sed 's#shaders/<k>#shaders/compact/<k>#g' | git apply --3way` carries a change that is outside the
  rewritten lines, then `bun run tools/qa/shaderrows-check.ts --stamp`. The check is RED while one of today's ten differs from what it was when its twin was last
  brought level (`tools/qa/fixtures/compact-kernels.json`), and names the kernel. Every tool that reads a kernel by its path (`dust-look-check`, the snow and fog
  probes …) reads TODAY's; `shadertrim-check` and any other harness tool takes the compact set under `TPS_COMPACTSHADERS=1`.
  **Start on first frame shaders (`?firstframe=1`, `gpu/device.ts PIPE_QUEUE.later`)**: the start waits only for what the first frame draws; the LATER set (direct,
  restirM, fgather, fgatherGi, fgatherGiS, reflectP5, composite, compositeR, compositeS, the five froxel kernels, the dust twin where dust is drawn, and volFroxel with
  the compact set) is not counted on the start card and is compiled behind it. With the compile queue on (a Windows browser) it is held until the boot's own are in, one
  at a time until the page settles, then in the queue's background lane (two at a time, shared with the cut set's twins); with the queue off (everywhere else) every
  creation goes straight to the browser, so the set is only not WAITED for. Each pass takes its stand-in meanwhile (the list above), and WHAT THE ENGINE WRITES IS FOR
  THE PROGRAM THAT RUNS: `engine.render` asks `passes.restirStandsIn` and `passes.restirMReady` before it writes the frame's flags and the restir uniform. As the row
  first came over, a frame the camera moved ran main's restir while `restirM` was out with the motion taps still packed into `cfg.y`, the word main's program reads as
  its spatial count: 0x603, about 1,500 taps a pixel, for as long as the twin took. That is the likeliest cause of the 2 to 5 s at about 5 fps seen on the Windows
  machine some 8 s after the start, and nobody has gone back to that machine to see it gone. A LATER pipeline that fails to compile hands back null (logged; the pass
  keeps its stand-in, and a froxel set that failed leaves the per-pixel march drawing); one that arrives after its place was filled (a composite retune, a hot swap)
  leaves the place alone (`ProgramSet.baseOf`). Auto quality's boot calibration waits while `laterProgress.pending` is above 0 (it would measure the stand-ins and keep
  the answer); the ladder after it does not wait. With the row off `engine.render`'s `sharp` is `sharpAsked`, the line as it always was, the estimator is the setting,
  and the froxel kernels join the cut swap after their build, in the order they always did. **Left as they came, and known**: a debug view or TAAU off while no
  fragment composite is in clears the picture (black until one lands: no preset does either); the set compiles in the order it is asked for (the froxel kernels
  first, the composites last), not the order a tier needs it; a page that never settles the queue (the workbench, the editor) gets it one at a time; the compact K = 0
  twin is built from the boot's prelude alone, outside the cut swap, and is picked ahead of the dust and froxel twins (no preset runs K = 0).
  **The checks**: `bun run tools/qa/shaderrows-check.ts` (the Engine and the particle system on a stand-in device that holds every async creation, four arms each a
  process of its own: off, compact, first, both, plus the rows' own module on a stand-in page; it reads which program each pass is given and what the engine wrote
  for it, with the later set out and in: 118 lines; `SHADERROWS_BREAK=1` hands each arm another's rows and fails 23; the same on both stands); `pipequeue-check` has
  the later lane and the needed one of the bullet below (42 lines in all; `PIPEQUEUE_BREAK=1` fails 28); `TPS_COMPACTSHADERS=1 bun run tools/qa/shaderinline-check.ts` sizes the compact set against its own table
  (`BUDGET_COMPACT`: the boot's set 8.2 MB pasted where today's is 13.1, the cut set 7.3 where today's is 12.1, 129 kernels; composite 574 KB where today's is 978,
  `fgather / main` 228 where 780; `SHADERINLINE_BREAK=1` with it fails as it must; with the row off the tool's own table is green on this tree, as before);
  `node tools/qa/shaderrows-page.cjs` is the real page on the software adapter (the rows on the screen before and after the renderer is up, a boot with both rows
  kept, a boot on `?firstframe=1`; the queue off unless `QUEUE=1`).
  **Off is the build as it was**: a recorded boot (every module's text by digest, every pipeline with its module, entry point and constants, the cut set's build, the
  program each pass is given over twelve settings, and each of those frames' uniform block and restir uniform by digest) is byte for byte that of the build head it was last joined to, on
  both stands: 57 modules, 110 pipelines, 974 picks (the Engine and the particle system; the smoke solver, the light probe and the mesh shadows are not in that
  recording and none of their files changed).
  **What the trial costs while both writings are in the tree**: every page's bundle carries the second set's text (about half a megabyte) whether the row is on or
  not; `src/cloud/prefs.ts` skips `twopointsix.shaderrows` (a row is this machine's).
  **On the real page (headless Chromium, the software adapter; nothing here is a time on a real machine)**: `tools/qa/draw-equal.cjs` (`--with compactshaders=1`, a
  new word of the tool: a query added to every view's address) at 640x360, high, the compact set against today's on the same commit: the rain at dusk EQUAL at both
  checkpoints, the firefight EQUAL at its first (230,400 pixels each, by sha256). The firefight's second checkpoint has no pair: TODAY's page lost the software adapter's device there three times out of three (`A valid external Instance reference no longer exists`, with the queue on and off, once before its first checkpoint), where the compact page drew all seven frames; that is this box's adapter under today's kernels and says nothing of the row. The compact page booted with 119 of 119 pipelines and no GPU error
  both times. `shaderrows-page.cjs`: with nothing kept and the renderer still compiling, Options > Graphics has Shaders with both rows Disabled; both put on are kept;
  the next load (medium, the queue off) counted 104 pipelines on its start card where a load with the rows off counts 118, every later pipeline came in, frames after it
  march the froxels, none failed and nothing was on the console; Options then shows both Enabled and Reset to defaults puts both off and takes the kept line away. With
  the queue off this adapter had the later set in before the start resolved (nothing holds it back; it is only not waited for). `QUEUE=1 … first` (`?firstframe=1` at
  high, the queue on, as a Windows browser gets it): ready with no fragment composite and no froxel kernels in and 40 creations in the queue, frames meanwhile drawn by
  sharp direct with the froxel flag down, everything in 22 minutes later on this adapter (the later set and the wall-cut twins share the two background slots), no
  error, and the address's word not kept.
  **Not seen**: either row on a GPU from this side (the numbers and the pixel-for-pixel word of the bullet above are the Windows machine's, on the tree they were
  written in); the slow seconds after the start gone on that machine; any of it on a Mac.
- **Other shaders when needed (2026-10-26; the fourth Shaders row, `?shaderswhenneeded=1`, harness `TPS_SHADERSWHENNEEDED=1`, `gpu/device.ts PIPE_QUEUE.held`).** OFF by
  default on both stands, the next load's, a switch of the page like the rows above (no knob, no `FROZEN_HOLDS` row). **How it sits beside Start on first frame
  shaders**: that row stops WAITING for the later set and compiles it behind the start; this one does not compile it at all until a frame wants it. It raises that
  row's lane by itself (`PIPE_QUEUE.later`), so it works alone, and with both on the set is held (this row wins). The stand-ins, the null on a failed compile and the
  place-already-filled rule are that lane's, unchanged.
  **What is held** (never asked of the browser until needed): direct, restirM, fgather, fgatherGi, fgatherGiS, reflectP5, the fragment composite pair (composite,
  compositeR), compositeSR, the dust twin, the five froxel kernels, and volFroxel with the compact set. One difference from the first-frame row: there the start waits
  for compositeSR and leaves compositeS for later; here the start waits for compositeS (what a sharp frame with no pane draws) and holds the refraction twin until a
  sharp frame has a pane to bend through. Each held pipeline is a thunk under its field's name in `LightingPasses.held`; `need(key)` runs it once (`asked` lists
  them in order, `heldKeys` what is left; `Froxels.need()` for the five). **Who asks**: the encode, at the place it picks the program (the gather by `giOn` and
  `gatherStrata`, `pReflP5` with phase 5, `pVolDust` with the dust look, `pCompSR` on a sharp frame with a pane, the fragment twin this frame's glass wants whenever
  the settings composite through it, `fragAsked`, even while sharp direct stands in), and `engine.render` for what it decides itself (`pDirect` with ReSTIR off,
  `pRestirM` on a frame the motion pass would run with ReSTIR set, the froxel kernels and `pVolF` on a tier that marches them). So a quality change by hand or by
  Auto's ladder, a debug view, a pass switched on in the debugger and sharp direct shed or coming back all reach it the same way: the first frame at the new
  settings. Nothing is asked for ahead of that frame.
  **The cut set** (render/cutSwap.ts): built while a pipeline is still held, it leaves that pipeline's twin out and carries nothing under the field (`holdCut`); the
  need compiles the pair. While the cut set is live the pass stands in until the TWIN is in, so the boot's program, which has no cut rule, landing first is never
  drawn beside programs that have it; `Froxels.ready` likewise waits for its two cut twins when a cut set had been asked for. A twin that fails is `cutSwap.fail`,
  as a failed set is.
  **The queue** (a Windows browser, `?pipequeue=1`): a needed pipeline stays in the background lane (these are the heavy kernels: still at most two of that lane in
  flight, as measured, and never ahead of a pass's own small pipeline) but is the NEXT that lane starts, ahead of every wall-cut twin nobody is waiting on
  (`laterPipelineAsync(…, needed)`). So on Windows a tier step's program waits for one of the two compiles in flight to end, not for the whole cut set; on a page that
  never settles the queue the needed ones go side by side. Its cut twin, where a second set left it out, is an ordinary member of that lane.
  **The ladder holds for it** (`src/ui/quality.ts STANDS_IN`, its owner's hunk carried here): while `laterProgress.pending` is above 0 (`engine.standsIn`: a pass
  draws with a stand-in for a program that is compiling; a held cut twin counts) the running ladder drops its window and moves none of its clocks, so it neither
  judges the step it just took nor takes another, for at most 30 s in one wait (`Quality.standsInFor`); past that it runs again, on the stand-in's times. With the
  rows off the count is never above 0. `quality-plan` case D1 (three lines; `LADDERHOLD_BREAK=1` fails two). A step to a tier whose programs are held therefore
  draws that tier's settings through the stand-ins until they land: a whole picture every frame in the presets, not yet the tier's cost.
  **A place filled meanwhile** (a composite retune, a hot swap, while the pipeline was held): the need leaves it alone and still compiles the twin a second set left
  out, so that set's place is not empty for good.
  **Left as it is, and known**: a debug view or TAAU off while no fragment composite is in clears the picture until one lands. With the first-frame row that window is
  the seconds after the start; with this row it is the first time either is turned on in a session, for as long as `composite` takes (the biggest kernel: 5 to 25 s
  on the Windows machines this is for). No preset and no Options row does either. If the fragment pair fails to compile, sharp direct stays the picture and asks for
  its own refraction twin. Two module texts are still handed to the browser at the start (the sharp composite's refraction twin and the froxel kernels share a
  source with a waited pipeline): parsed, not compiled. The smoke solver, the denoiser, the particle system and the wall-cut set are not this row's; the wall-cut
  set has its own row.
  **What it saves, by pasted size** (`shaderinline-check`'s measure of what DXC is handed, today's kernels): the held set is about 9.8 MB of the boot set's 13.1 and
  about 9.8 of the cut set's 12.1. A session on high that never sheds sharp direct never compiles about 5.8 MB of the boot set (direct 405 KB, fgather 780,
  fgatherGi 842, fgatherGiS 842, reflectP5 639, composite 977, compositeR 977, the froxel kernels about 349), nor the dust twin (715) until the first dust, nor
  their cut twins. A session on medium compiles the froxel kernels on its first frame and the rest of that list never (compositeSR is compiled on either tier once a pane is on screen).
  **The checks**: `bun run tools/qa/shaderswhenneeded-check.ts` (the Engine on a stand-in device that holds every async creation; five arms, each its own process:
  off, first, needed, both, compact; the start asks for none of the held set and makes none of its own modules, frames at a high-like tier ask for nothing, each
  first need asks once for its own program with the stand-in drawn and `standsIn` up, the froxels and a held pipeline under a live cut set wait for their cut twins,
  what no frame asked for is never made: 188 lines; `SHADERSWHENNEEDED_BREAK=1` hands each arm another's rows and fails 51; the same on both stands);
  `shaderrows-check` and `pipequeue-check` above stay green with it. **Off is the build as it was**: `shaderrows-check.ts --dump` for the off, first, compact and
  both arms is line for line that of the tree this was built on.
  **On the real page (headless Chromium 153.0.8010.12, the software adapter, the title page, the queue off; no time here is a real machine's)**:
  `node tools/qa/shader-count-page.cjs --settle 150 --then <tier> '?shaderswhenneeded=1&pipequeue=0'` (the tool now names what was made after ready, what a frame
  asked for and what is still held). `?firstframe=1` at medium, for the comparison: ready in 250 s, 146 pipelines from 66 modules, 1906 KB of shader text handed over
  at the start. This row at medium: ready in 100 to 108 s, 128 pipelines from 52 modules over the whole visit, 1278 KB at the start; a frame asked for the five froxel
  kernels (their two cut twins once the five were in) and for compositeSR with its cut twin (the title's level has glass); `quality → high` then asked for nothing;
  still held at the end: pDirect, pRestirM, pFG, pFGR, pFGRs, pReflP5, pVolDust, pComp, pCompR. At high: 121 pipelines, a frame asked for compositeSR alone, and
  `quality → medium` then made the five froxel kernels with their two cut twins and nothing else. No pipeline failed and no GPU error on any of them. Pages ran two
  at a time on four cores, so the seconds compare only roughly. `PORT=… node tools/qa/shaderrows-page.cjs needed` (a walk asked for by name, 6 lines): the row is
  under Shaders and Disabled; put on, it reads Enabled and is kept; the next load at high with no word comes ready with ten pipelines held, none asked for and no
  error; Options shows it Enabled; Reset to defaults puts it off and takes the kept line away.
  **Not seen**: any of it on a GPU, on Windows or on a Mac; what a held compile costs a frame in the middle of play on a real machine (the hitch the row trades the
  start for); Auto's ladder with the row on, and how long a tier step's program waits in the Windows queue; this row with the wall-cut row on together (read, and
  the two checks green on one tree, never run on a page).
- **Separate shadow rays (a Shaders row, 2026-10-26; OFF by default on both stands, the next load's; `?splitrays=1`, `TPS_SPLITRAYS=1` in front of a headless
  tool; `render/gatherSplit.ts`, `shaders/gather_split.wgsl`).** A trial for the Windows shader wait: the final gather stops being one megakernel. Today
  `fgather.wgsl`'s `main` lights every point its rays land on inside itself, so `directAtPoint` (the light loop and its three shadow rays, 123 KB a copy as DXC
  pastes it) is written at four places and `main` is 780 KB out of a 92 KB module. With the row on the same frame is two programs made from the same helpers:
  `trace` (pass `gather`) casts the rays and writes each point that wants light to a buffer (the point, its normal, its bounce-card set, its paint, the radiance it
  already has), `light` (a pass of its own, `gatherLight`, so the Tab list and the F9 recorder price the two halves apart) lights them in one loop round ONE
  `directAtPoint`, takes the firefly bound, and stores what the gather stores. The cut-box set gets the same two (they are made in `traceJobs`, like every traced
  pipeline). **Sizes (the size tool, `TPS_SPLITRAYS=1 bun run tools/qa/shaderinline-check.ts`):** `trace` 249 KB and `light` 125 KB where `main` is 780 KB and
  `mainGi` 842 KB; a load's boot set goes from 13,110 KB to 10,490 KB and both sets together from 25,175 KB to 19,935 KB. The split set has budget rows of its own
  (261 and 131 KB, in place of the megakernel gathers' rows only while the row is on); no row of today's table moves. What is left in `trace`: `occluded` ×4
  (the cards' term, the glints, a pane's dust), `traceClosest` ×3, `glossGlints` ×2 and a pane's shading at 97 KB.
  **Row off = the build as it was:** every one of the 64 module texts a load compiles is the same text, hash for hash, as on the build's head without this change.
  **Not the same random numbers as today, by design:** in `main` the light loop draws from the texel's one stream (one number a light that reaches the point), so
  the next ray's direction depends on a count only the light loop knows; the split's rays use `main`'s stream without those draws and each point's light pick has a
  stream of its own (`gxFork`). The estimate is the same one, a frame is other noise of the same size. So the split is not compared with today's picture bit for
  bit but with a TWIN: today's megakernel drawing from the split's streams (`tools/qa/splitrays-twin.cjs`, loaded through the gather's hot hook by
  `DRAW_EQUAL_AFTER_READY=tools/qa/splitrays-twin.cjs node tools/qa/draw-equal.cjs capture …`), against `--with splitrays=1`. **Pictures (software adapter, Chrome for Testing 153, 640×360, high, drawn frames
  3 and 7, two views with no cut piece in them: `office-night` and `glass-broken`):** the row's picture against the twin's differs in 0.23–0.51 % of the pixels, by
  at most 2 of 255 levels (mean 0.001–0.002 levels): what the buffer rounds (paint and unlit radiance as f16, a slanted normal as 16 + 16 bits) and the order two
  sums are taken in. Against TODAY's build the same frames differ in 23–29 % of the pixels by up to 11 levels (ten pixels over 8 in `office-night`, none in
  `glass-broken`; mean 0.13–0.17 levels, the pictures' mean brightness the same to three decimals) — and the twin differs from today by the same amounts to the
  pixel count, so that distance is the other random draws, not the split. Both pages booted with every pipeline made (117 with the row on, 118 without) and no console or GPU error; `gatherLight` is in the
  frame's pass list. The views' own expectations were unmet the same way on every arm (two of three torches counted in frame; no pane broken in `glass-broken`), so
  the pane's mirror ray was drawn through whole panes only. After the review's changes the row's first two frames were drawn again and are the same pixels, and the same again after a hot reload of the gather with the
  row on (`__hotGather()`: the three pipelines rebuilt, no error).
  **What the row does not cover yet (say it when it is tried):** the resampling gather (`mainGi`, ultra's) is not built while the row is on: the plain split
  gather draws ultra's bounce and no reservoirs are kept (`setGi`), so ultra looks and costs different under the row (the row's own words say so; the debugger's
  resampling line still reads the setting, not what is drawn); the young-history rays (a Tab row, in no preset) are not traced; a hot reload (`__hotGather`,
  `__hotCommon`) rebuilds the split's three pipelines from the given texts' helpers, so an edit inside `main`'s own body is not drawn and the answer says so; the
  shadow rays of the cards' term, the glints and a pane's dust stay in `trace`. `trace`, `glossReflectionX` and `glassShadeX` are hand copies of `main`,
  `glossReflection` and `glassShade` (the check pins the originals by hash, it cannot prove the copies follow): making them from `fgather.wgsl` by a text swap, as
  the twin is made, is the next step if the row is kept. Reflect, restir, particles, the
  marches and the composites are untouched. **The buffer** is 240 bytes a gather texel (60 a rendered pixel at gather /2: 55 MB at 1280×720 inside, 124 MB at
  1920×1080), written and read once a frame, grown with the gather grid and let go for a smaller one when the grid is under half of it; a grid whose buffer the adapter
  cannot bind, or the GPU cannot make (an out-of-memory scope round its creation), is refused with one console error, the bounce is not drawn, and that size is
  not tried again in the visit. That is the frame cost to measure on a real GPU beside the two passes' times. **With Compact shaders also on, the split wins for the
  gather:** it is made from today's `fgather.wgsl` and `gather_common.wgsl`, imported by `gatherSplit.ts` itself, whatever other writing of those kernels the load
  compiles. **Check:** `bun run tools/qa/splitrays-check.ts` (probe `splitrays`, family `shaders`; eleven lines: `trace` reaches no light loop, `light` reaches
  `directAtPoint` through one call site, the buffer's layout is one number in the shader and the engine, the three functions of `fgather.wgsl` the split was
  copied from are pinned by hash — a change to `main`, `glossReflection` or `glassShade` goes into `gather_split.wgsl` too — the twin builds, and what a load
  compiles with the row off and on); `SPLITRAYS_BREAK=1` (the row left off where the lines turn it on) fails three, the same on both stands.
  **Never seen on a GPU; nobody has timed a Windows compile with it; no frame time measured anywhere.**
- **The outline in the dark** (`render/outline.ts`, `shaders/outline.wgsl`; 2026-10-20): one scissored, blended triangle onto the composite after the fog of
  war and before the resolve, reading the G-buffer's id and depth targets, made only while the player's Options row is on. What it is for, what it costs
  and what nobody has seen: `docs/agents/menus.md`, "Finding your own man". A pass that wants whose-pixel-is-this can take it as its model: the owner byte
  is bits 20 to 27 of the id target on a character's mesh and on every box emitted for him.
- **The bounce is never read through a wall off a man (`BOUNCE_WALLS`, the scene prelude's const — `render/frame.ts bounceWallsConfig`, ON; `?nobouncewalls` at boot = every
  read as it was; no game table, nothing for a recording to carry, the same on both stands).** The maintainer, 10-20, the pass at night, the squad in the snow against
  the tea room's outer wall, the debugger's direct / specular / indirect views: "i think there's some leak on direct and specular and indirect with the wall here", and
  "also happens on this side too". WHAT IT WAS: the radiance cache (`diceIrradiance`, a 1 m lattice) is read a probe spacing along a face's normal — sound for a wall,
  and for a man stood by a wall the room behind it. (1) Indirect: a gather ray that HIT a man read the room off his side that faces the wall; a ray that LEFT a man (or
  the lip of a boot print: a shading normal well off a box face's own) for the wall was bounded by `diceIrradianceFrom` as if the plane it left were a wall, and
  "the cell centre is behind it: step to the cell on its side" stepped the read into the room. (2) Specular: a coat's sheen (`composite.wgsl wetCoatSpec`) mirrored
  the cache a spacing along the man's normal: the room's lamps on his rims. (3) Direct: nothing found — the reach masks drop the room's lights from the cells outside
  (dumped for the pass: level 0 in every cell beyond the walls), what his direct view shows is the moon; the few warm specks on the men's rims there are NOT explained.
  THE RULE: `lighting_common.wgsl diceWalledPoint(Ph, n, skip)` — the read point a spacing along n, stopped 5 cm short of the NEAREST box on that line (`occludedTBoxes`
  answers the first box it meets, the ground before a wall: it is asked again short of each answer; men's proxies are not asked, and `skip` names up to two men whose
  carried boxes are not either — his own gun must not hide the air from him), then a box ray to the centre of each of its four plan cells: the read keeps all four,
  else the one column / row / cell it sees, and where it sees none there is NO read (dark, never the room). Asked where the hit is a man or a box he carries
  (`bounceHitMan`: the gather's rays, the ray-traced reflections' hit shading, the cache's own probes in `hitRadiance`; NOT the gather program's own gloss and pane
  rays, which keep the old read: below), where the surface a gather ray
  left is no wall (`bounceLeftNoWall`: a man's pixel; within 2 m, a normal more than a dozen degrees off every axis), and for the sheen. Everything else reads as before (since 10-23 a metal's reflection rays ask it too: REFL WALLS, the next bullet).
  THE SOFTWARE ADAPTER'S ROOM (10-20, the same day: the build with the rule lost its GPU device — "A valid external Instance reference no longer exists", the GPU
  process dead of a segfault — on the first frame a CUT piece was alive: a wall charge in `soundlanes-page.cjs`'s walk, a bang entry that broke cover). The software
  adapter builds a copy of a function for every place it is written, the read wrote `occludedTBoxes` in three places and the gather asked the read in five: fifteen
  more box walks in the gather's program, each with the cut test inside in the cut twin (`render/cutSwap.ts`), and that twin no longer ran. Bisected on the blown-wall
  still (`node tools/qa/cut-stills.cjs --root . --out <dir> --tag after --cut --scene wall --cam near --quality verylow --w 320 --h 180 --settle 3 --physics 30`, ten
  minutes a run, one run each): rule in the probes alone clean, probes + sheen clean, gather + reflections dead; the walk written ONCE (five more walks in the gather)
  clean at verylow and high; a second written walk (ten) dead. So the read's loop asks ONE written walk up to eight times, and the gather's gloss and pane rays (a man
  mirrored in a floor or a pane) went back to the old read: three more walks. THE RULE FOR WHOEVER EDITS `fgather.wgsl` NEXT: its cut twin is within a handful of
  written box walks of what the software adapter runs; after adding a trace, draw that still. Nobody knows whether any real GPU has such a limit (none was reported).
  `?nobouncewalls` rides a replay page's address (`ui/replaykey.ts VISIT_FLAGS`).
  NOT MENDED: the light meter (`probe.wgsl`) reads the cache AT the man, blended over the cells around him — by a lit room's wall some are the room's (the meter's
  owner's; untouched here). The firefly cap of the reflections (`Eref`) still reads the old point. COST: five to eight short box rays per asked read — every pixel of a
  man for the sheen, his gather rays, and near rays off steep snow or yawed boxes; never timed on a GPU.
  CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts bouncewalls` (family `render`; `BOUNCEWALLS_BREAK=1` fails 3 of its first 5 lines; its last 3 are REFL WALLS'; both stands): the shader's rule and every site held by
  their text, and a TypeScript copy (its ray is the nearest box, as the shader's ask-again loop) weighed for men stood 0.33 to 0.9 m off every ceiling-high wall of all
  50 levels, a shin's down-turned skin among the points — reads that blend a cell beyond a wall 42.8 % → 14 of 1.46 M (the pass's tea room: 44.5 % of skin points and
  40.5 % of rays to the wall → 0; a print's lip at the wall's foot 165 of 500 → 0, the 100 that lean 0.15 clean either way and not asked). No shader runs there.
  PAGE: the final text compiled on the software adapter (the pass, squad of four, hard, medium and high quality: 119 of 119 pipelines, no GPU error on the console). STILLS there (one seed, 783×500 at half scale,
  five men stood at the tea room's west wall, the lean-to's bulb put out so the yard has the moon alone, `?nobouncewalls` against the page as it opens, the same
  frames each): the indirect view's men had orange flanks on the side that faces the wall and the snow at the wall's foot an orange streak — pixels redder than blue
  by 6 of 255 on the men's wall side 1623 → 1, on the strip of snow 592 → 1; the spec view's orange rims 1261 → 15; the men stay moon-blue, not black. Eight frames,
  not converged. Never seen on a GPU: the picture in motion, the cost, and whether a man's dark side reads too dark where the walled point sees one cell.
- **A metal never mirrors the room behind a wall (`REFL_WALLS`, the scene prelude's const — `render/frame.ts reflWallsConfig`, ON; `?noreflwalls` at boot = the rule
  off; no game table, no journal line, no `FROZEN_HOLDS` row: nothing in the update reads it and the headless stands draw nothing)** (10-23). The maintainer, the solo
  night's manager's office at high, one desk lamp lit: "some weird light leakage on bookshelf? seems like irradiance cache leak through wall? and showing up in
  specular?" — the steel shelving on the partition to the lit storage room glowed a dull orange, and only debug view 10 (specular) showed it. CAUSE: a ray-traced
  reflection shades its hit with `diceIrradiance(Ph + hit.n × c0Spacing(), hit.n)`. For a hit on a wall the spacing leads into the room. For a hit whose normal runs
  ALONG a partition within half a cell of it (a shelf board, the floor at the wall's foot, the ceiling over it, an upright's side) the read stays by the wall and its
  four plan cells straddle it: with the wall on the metre lattice the share of the cells beyond is 0.5 less the distance to the wall's line, 0.1 to 0.27 on that unit's
  boards and 0.44 at the wall's foot. A dielectric shows a few per cent of its mirror at this camera; a metal shows all of it (F0 = its paint, and composite steps a
  metal's diffuse back 70 %), so the steel glowed and the cartons on it did not. The 08-12 mend (`diceIrradianceFrom`) is the gather's and bounds a read by the plane
  the ray LEFT; it was never asked by the reflections ("listed for a follow-up if a case shows") and would not have held this one: the wall is neither plane.
  THE RULE: a metal pixel's reflection rays (`metalness > 0.25` in `reflect.wgsl` / `reflect_p5.wgsl` main) shade every hit with the walled read
  (`diceWalledPoint`: stopped short of the nearest box along the normal, the footprint held to the cells the point can see, no read where it sees none), the reflecting
  pixel's owner in the skip word; every other pixel's rays keep the read they had. The box walk is written no more often than before (the sites that asked it for a
  hit on a man now also take the metal's word), so the software adapter's program is no bigger. `?nobouncewalls` alone no longer gives the picture from before both
  rules where a man is mirrored in steel: that takes both words. `?noreflwalls` rides a replay page's address (`VISIT_FLAGS`).
  NOT MENDED: the same blend in the DIFFUSE gather's hits for rays that did not leave that wall (× the look's indirect scale 0.35, and not seen in his indirect view);
  the gather's gloss and pane mirror reads (low and verylow trace no reflections; that program has no room for a fourth walled site); a pane's mirror
  (`diceMeanRadiance(Pg + Rg × 0.6)`); the light meter (`probe.wgsl` reads the cache at the man: no LIGHT number moves with this switch, the reflections are picture
  only); phase 5's hit-lighting reuse (`rtHitReuse`, off on every preset) keys its record by box and place, not by which read made it. THE GENERAL MEND, proposed and
  not built: the cache writes, per cell, which of its plan neighbours its centre can see (a few short box rays where it already traces hundreds, so doors and blown
  walls follow), and `diceIrradiance` itself holds its footprint to those — every reader mended with no rays at the read, this rule and BOUNCE WALLS' rays retired.
  COST: five to eight short box rays more for each ray of a metal pixel (steel shelving, lockers, door leaves, the GWOT kit's sheet metal; two rays a pixel on ultra);
  never timed on a GPU. RISK, from the review's count on the check's own model: away from walls the walled read also moves 15 % of floor reads that never leaked
  (stopped short of furniture, or one line to a cell blocked by a desk leg) and 3 % of wall-face reads see no cell and go dark, so a steel face may show a step or a
  dark patch in its mirror of clutter. Never seen on a GPU.
  CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts bouncewalls` (family `render`), its last three lines; `REFLWALLS_BREAK=1` fails two of them; both stands. The text of the rule in
  both passes, the prelude and the flag; and the same TypeScript copy of the read weighed for faces that look up (the floor, a board's height) or down (the ceiling)
  6 to 40 cm off every ceiling-high wall of all 56 levels, the boxes turned a quarter put back so the shelving's own boards stop the walk: reads that blend a cell
  beyond a wall 195,120 of 292,051 (66.8 %) → 0, with 1.0 % seeing no cell (dark); at the office's partition 397 of 508 → 0, 24 dark. No shader runs there.
  PAGE (the software adapter, one seed, 640×360 with 492×277 inside at high, `?solo&paused&quality=high&mute`, the camera pinned on the unit from the office side, 24
  frames, `?noreflwalls` against the page as it opens): the final text compiled and drew with no GPU or page error. The specular view at exposure × 4, in display
  levels of 255: the uprights' inner faces 19.4 → 0.7 (their brightest point 53 → 2), the lowest board's top 6.3 → 1.0, the next 1.6 → 0.7, the top board 4.7 → 3.4,
  the unit's whole rectangle on screen 4.08 → 1.70 in the mean and 11.7 → 2.4 at its ninetieth percentile; in the final frame the uprights 3.1 → 0.3 and the lowest
  board 1.4 → 0.3; the indirect view is the same to the digit at every point (the diffuse is not touched). What stays, the same with the switch either way, is a warm
  streak on the front edges of the top two boards: read as the desk lamp's own highlight (inferred, not traced). No step or dark patch showed in that one view. Never
  seen on a GPU: the picture in motion, the cost, and steel anywhere but this unit.
- **The flame's sample count is a number** (`FIRE.look.steps`, 40; the look row's fifteenth float, `K.d.z`; `?firesteps=N`, 4 to 64; a row in `/firelab`;
  `LOOK='steps=12'` in `tools/qa/fire-lab.cjs`). No rule and no switch: 40 is the count the shader had, and a recording from before the key gets 40. It is
  there for a TIMING: the flame's price is the count × the pixels it covers, at sigma 2.5 no ray goes opaque so none stops early, and a model (nobody's
  timing) puts the flame over its bar at the closest zoom at High. On a real GPU, compare the page as it opens with `&firesteps=18` and `&firesteps=24`
  for the price and for bands in the flame. Checked: the shader compiles and draws at 40 and at 12 on the software adapter, shader alone (the same flame, a
  faint stipple at 12); `fire-check`'s look line carries the count. NEVER SEEN OR TIMED ON A GPU; the whole page was not booted.
- **An open fire burns (`src/game/fire.ts FIRE`, `render/shaders/fire.wgsl`; 2026-10-23, the maintainer: "we gotta improve our fire! we have barrels with fire on them …
  great fire with smoke and crackles and dynamic lighting would look sick").** Until now such a drum was a glowing lid and a steady lamp. A level light whose id starts
  with `brazier` is a fire (`pass.json` and `tut-sky.json` have one each; `docs/level-format.md`, the lights row). SWITCH: `FIRE.on`, ON in the page (`?fire=0` = the
  lid and the steady lamp), OFF in the module and on the frozen stand (`TPS_FIRE=1`); its table rides the journal and a recording from before the key replays with it off.
  THE FLUID SOLVER IS USED FOR THE SMOKE AND NOT FOR THE FLAME: a flame is 40 cm across and changes shape in a tenth of a second, the solver's cells are 5.5 cm and it
  publishes density, not heat, to the picture — a flame made of it would be seven cells wide, cost bricks at every preset and still need a shader to colour it; smoke is
  what the solver is for (it climbs, leans in the wind, pools under a roof, is lit by every lamp and shadowed).
  THE LIGHT is the level's own lamp, no new light: its strength × `fireFlicker` (smooth noise at five rates 0.43‥8.3 Hz + a kick with each crack of the wood: 0.69 to
  1.37 of the authored 9 over twenty seconds, mean 0.985, RMS about 0.15, never under `least` 0.6 or over `most` 1.6), its place lifted `lift` 0.25 m into the flame (the
  level hangs it 16 cm over a lid 58 cm wide: from there the lid is lit white and a flame is lost on it) and wandering 6 cm, and while it burns the emitter is `size`
  1.1 of the mouth's radius, the flame's own reach (0.24 m on the pass's drum; the level's 6 cm pinpoint drew the drum's own shadow as a black disc a metre round it:
  SEEN ON A GPU, below; `size` 0 = the level's, `?firesize=0` in the page, to compare on a GPU; the level's size is back the frame the fire is out or the switch goes
  off, and a recording from before the key replays with `size` 0. A level's own radius is kept when it is the bigger). WHO READS IT: the light meter of a man
  beside it and every caller of `lightEstimateAt` that does not ask for the steady light (the review of the second cut listed three that ask what a PLACE lights and
  so read the flicker: `guards.ts litPlace`'s dark test, `doortools.ts thrLitCell`, kept for the order, and `nvg.ts nvgPlaceLight` — a cell near `LIGHTS.litAt`
  beside a fire can fall either side by the flicker's phase; they also count flashes, so handing them `steadyOnly` is their owners' call and was not made here).
  The steady readers — `lightEstimateAt(…, steadyOnly)` (the calm torch, the dark-floor and dark-door rules) is handed the AUTHORED lamp where the level hung
  it and the size the level gave it through `RtLight.steady` (guards.ts; the fog of war's remembered lamp likewise), the same number every frame as with the switch off (the check's `steady` line, bit for bit).
  THE FLAME, THE BED OF COALS AND THE EMBERS are drawn by the composite (`fireOver`, beside the lasers' light in the air; records in the beams uniform, `passes.ts
  setFires`, four fires at most, the nearest the view): a marched volume 24 steps deep that hides what is behind it within three fingers (`FIRE_SIGMA` 14 /m; 18 steps at 20 /m was a stipple, a pixel against its four
  neighbours 0.036 in the lab where the first cut was 0.015: this is 0.019), each tongue yellow at its root, orange up its length and red
  at its tip (`fireColor`, written as scene radiance and kept under the tone curve's shoulder: red from 0.4, orange 1.6, the yellow heart 2.1, a tenth more when the
  light kicks); a
  disc of char and deep orange gaps over the lid; ten embers climbing and six thrown by each crack, closed forms of the game's clock (nothing kept between frames: a replay
  draws the same fire). PICTURE ONLY.
  THE THIRD CUT (2026-10-23, the maintainer's second look on a GPU, with stills of a fluid-simulated camp fire as the target: "still very ugly. needs more
  dynamic range, smoke, embers, movement, could we do heat distortion?"; then "embers can be GPU particles though") REPLACES the paragraph above where they
  differ. The second cut had held the flame's radiance under the tone curve's shoulder, level with the snow it lights: that was the flat pale peach he saw.
  Now the flame is HDR inside and saturated at its skin (`fireColor`: dark red 0.07 at the tips and edge, through 0.3, 0.6, 1.05 and 1.9 of red, to a heart of
  9 × `core`; AgX at the page's exposure puts saturated red and orange between 0.1 and 1 of scene radiance and everything above pale, and the bloom, which has
  no threshold, spreads the heart), marched 32 steps and nearly opaque (`sigma` 12 /m), with distinct tongues (two slow noise reads lick the column sideways,
  a third cuts deep gaps between tongues and streaks the heat), rings that swell and climb about twice a second (`breathe`), a sooty cool edge (`soot`), and a
  column of SMOKE DRAWN STRAIGHT OFF ITS TIPS in the same march (`plume`, ten steps to 3.6 m, lit orange from below: the solver's own plume is look-only, thin
  and starts over a man's head, so by itself it never read as the fire's smoke; `?fireplume=0`). HEAT SHIMMER (`shimmer`, 1.2 cm; `?fireheat=0`): the composite's
  pixel is a pure function of where it is asked (`compositePixel`), so it is asked a little to one side: `fireWarp` sums `fireShimmer` over the fires (the ray's
  closest approach to the column over the flame, two noise reads that climb), nothing when the pixel's own surface is nearer than the column, and never in a
  debug view. THE EMBERS ARE GPU PARTICLES now (`render/particles.ts EmitOpts.ember`: a spark whose colour word's top byte is not 255 — `particles_common.wgsl
  emberIs`; lifted by `EMBER_LIFT` 3.2 m/s² and swirled, carried by the wind in full, drawn by `emberRadiance`, in the bloom like any spark): about `embers` 24
  alight over a fire within 30 m of the view, `emberCrack` 10 more thrown by a crack; filed by the host's book with a seed made by hand, so the game's own die
  and state are untouched (the check's `look` line: a game with a pool and one without differ in nothing); `?fireembers=0` = none; they are not drawn for a
  fire the fog remembers. The record is 64 bytes (no pop list); the look's ten numbers ride behind the four records (`passes.ts setFireLook`, `FireLook`).
  KNOWN, kept: no embers at all where the page has no GPU particles (`?noparticles`: the closed-form embers the composite drew are gone); embers are drawn
  after the composite, so the flame does not hide one behind it and the shimmer does not move them; an ember asks the wind as a puff of dust does (no wind
  record names sparks); the shimmer reads nothing that stands nearer than the column, here or where it would read; the flame thins out under the top of what
  is marched (2.3 × its height) so a kicked tongue is not cut flat; THE DRAWN SMOKE AND THE FLAME ARE PICTURE ONLY (no sight line or sensor knows of them:
  a man behind the column is hidden from the player a little and from nobody else, which bends "one model for picture and AI"; the flame as gas in the smoke
  solver, the maintainer's pick and the next step, is what makes the smoke real; until then `plume` is a slider and `?fireplume=0` a word).
  A recording from before `FIRE.look` replays with no shimmer, no drawn smoke and no embers. THE FIRE LAB: `/firelab` on the dev server
  (`?levelFile=pass.json&roomclear&squad4&nofow&firelab`, `src/host/firelab.ts`, on the sneak lab's pattern): you beside the brazier, nobody able to notice or
  hurt you, every number of the look, the embers, the light and the drifting smoke as a live slider, the build's back by a button, the lot copied out as one line.
  NEVER SEEN ON A GPU: the look was set on the software adapter's stills (`tools/qa/fire-lab.cjs`, which now emulates the bloom and the tone curve: `LOOK='k=v,…'`).
  THE FLAME AS GAS (`FIRE.gas`, OFF in the page until it has been seen: `?firegas=1`, and a row in the fire lab; 2026-10-23, the maintainer on a card asking
  how much of the flame should be real fluid sim: "Drive it from our 3D smoke solver", then "i'm curious how far we can push our existing smoke solver.
  curious if we can make the finer cells work well with our existing brick stuff"). A fire within `viewR` 12 m of the view files a second look-only source
  every half second on the solver's FINE lattice (2.2 cm cells, the breath's and the gun gas's, the same brick pool; `lattice: 'fine'`) at the coals: HEAT
  with next to no smoke in it (`temp` 22, `density` 0.3 a second, leaving at 1.8 m/s). The solver lifts it by its own buoyancy, curls it and leans it in the wind, and the
  picture draws the flame from that heat (`fire.wgsl fireFlameG` through `composite.wgsl fireGas` = `smoke_read.wgsl spgFineHot`): white-hot at `ref`, no
  flame under `lo` of it, the noise only tearing the skin finer than a cell. A fire's record carries how far it has eased to its gas (`FireRecord.gas`, the
  host's book), so a fire far from the view, on a preset that sheds fire smoke or with no solver is the flame of noise; while it is gas the drawn smoke is
  off. TWO CHANGES TO THE SOLVER (`src/smoke`, no thread's own: the last change there was the breath's, 10-20), both nothing while the switch is off:
  (1) HOT GAS ON THE FINE LATTICE IS KEPT — `sparse.fineKeep` (0 = no such rule, the solver as it was; the uniform's spare word): the fine lattice fades
  gas under `thinBelow` 0.25 and the heat in it at up to 3 /s (THE FINE LATTICE LETS GO), which made the first gas flame (drawn from density) a lick whose
  length hung on how dense it was and which lost its lift and lay over 45° in the yard's 0.7 m/s; with the rule a cell hotter than `fineKeep` is not thin
  and cools only at the solver's own 1.2 /s, so the flame's height is its cooling time. The fire raises it (`SmokeSystemLike.keepHot`, `FIRE.gas.keep` 0.8)
  while a fire's flame is gas and puts it back to 0; WHILE IT IS UP gun gas and breath that hot linger as long too (nobody has measured how hot they run).
  (2) A FINE BRICK'S HEAT IS PUBLISHED in its atlas texel's last channel (`publish`; nobody read that channel of a fine brick: `smoke_read.wgsl` is the
  atlas's only reader and takes `.x` of a fine brick), always, switch or no switch: a brick that holds heat and no density was already kept and published
  (its box counts either), so the page and the marches see what they saw. WHAT THE GAS IS TO THE GAME: its little density is the solver's own, so in the
  page a sight line through the flame loses what that smoke takes (thin by design; `density` is a lab slider), and the headless stands have no solver.
  FIRST CUT, kept in the log (d0e94537): the flame drawn from the fine lattice's DENSITY with no solver change; measured in the page (software adapter,
  lines asked of the game's sensors): the published gas ran about a fifth of the source's `density` at the heart, 0.8 a second was a half-metre lick and
  1.6 a metre and a half, the pool read 787 to 896 bricks three seconds in. CHECK: the fire check's `gas` line (heat sources as the table says, the solver
  told to keep hot gas and told to stop, the record's share, none without a solver or put off, an old recording off). IN THE PAGE (software adapter, the
  pass, the storm 0.5 m/s at the drum, five stills): a white heart, orange body, red tip, no haze; one streamer about a metre and a half long that the wind
  leans some 45° and curls (one streamer, not a field of tongues: one soft source, two-centimetre cells); a sensor's line through its heart keeps 0.90 of
  its light, every other line through the flame 0.97 or more; the pool 802 bricks three seconds in (275 fine) and 1,374 six seconds in with `temp` 22
  (445 fine; the pass's own cold smoke and the fire's coarse plume are in those). A gas flame is marched 56 steps (40 and 16 more) in a cylinder up to 0.8 m wider than the
  noise's (`fireGasWide`), so it costs half as much again a pixel over more pixels: not timed. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU, never seen moving.
  UNDER THE FOG OF WAR A FIRE IS DRAWN AS THE TEAM LAST SAW IT (`FIRE.fog`, on; `?firefog=0`; a recording from before the key replays with it
  off; 2026-10-23, the maintainer, playing the pass in plan mode on hard: "weird that fire doesn't show up in fog of war … I think we should at least show
  everything in the environment visible at the start of the level all the time?"). The first cut hid the flame over ground the fog hides, by the fog's rule for
  smoke and flakes; but a fire is part of the place, and the fog's picture (the full picture: the live frame dimmed) already had its lamp lighting the yard
  round a drum with a bare lid. Now a record carries the fog's own memory of the fire's lamp (`FireRecord.fog`, `RtLight.fog`'s numbers; `fireOver` asks
  `fogSeenAt` at the coals only for 1 and 2): burning and known to burn = 0, drawn wherever it stands (the fog pass dims it with its ground); lit where nobody saw
  (`RtLight.fog` 1) = 1, only where the team sees; put out where nobody saw (`fogGhost` up) = a record at full heat for where the team does NOT see, 2, beside the
  lamp's own ghost (which is the level's pinpoint where the level hung it: its shadow has the drawn edge). The records are built by `fireDraws`, which
  game.ts calls AGAIN right behind the fog's turn (`updateFire` runs before it): the frame a fire is put out unseen already draws it burning, not one frame of
  bare lid. KNOWN LIMITS, kept: the fog test is ONE per fire, at the coals, while the fog pass dims a pixel at a time (a flame astride the edge of what the team
  sees is drawn or not as a whole); a fire in the fog still leans on the LIVE wind (a door's gust the team did not see moves it) and flickers on the clock; a
  remembered fire counts toward the four drawn; `fireSummary`'s "drawn" counts it too; `FIRE.fog` has no stand word of its own (like `FIRE.smoke.on`, a
  picture-only key under the held `FIRE.on`: the frozen stand never draws a fire). NOT IN IT: THE FIRE'S SMOKE — `common.wgsl fogSmoke`
  hides all smoke over floor nobody sees and cannot tell a fire's plume from a grenade's, so a fire in the fog has no plume (the fog's rule, not this file's);
  and the fog's OTHER pictures (`?fogfull=0`: the paint under the remembered lamps) draw nothing of the composite, so no flame there, as before. The check's
  `fog` line (the real fog raised in the rig, the squad at its start, the brazier broken: `2@1.00` that very frame); drawn once in the page, the software adapter at Low, the squad left at its start on hard (`AWAY=1 QUERY='roomclear&squad4&difficulty=hard'`).
  NEVER SEEN ON A GPU. (The fog's remembered lamp, `?fogfull=0`'s, is the authored one, where the level hung it: fogofwar.ts `litBlock`.) Not in the ray-traced reflections; the level's glowing lid under it is dimmed to
  `coals` 0.42 of its authored glow (its bounce is that much less).
  THE SMOKE is a `look` source on the coarse lattice (`FIRE.smoke`), filed every second while the solver draws and the fire is within `viewR` 18 m of the view.
  LEARNT IN THE PAGE: a source two cells wide does NOT climb whatever its heat (temp 2.6 to 30: it hung within 0.3 to 0.6 m of where it was filed, an invisible haze
  at head height that cut a line along the wind at 1.6 m to 0.26); one five cells wide (radius 0.26, temp 30) climbs — so it is as wide as the drum and its FOOT is
  over a standing man's head (2.05 m; the check holds 1.9). MEASURED IN THE PAGE (`fire-page.cjs`, the pass, the software adapter at Low, the yard's 0.5 to 0.8 m/s of
  wind at the drum, a plume fifteen seconds old; the light each line keeps, a line starts to count smoke under 0.8): across the plume at 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7 m, over
  the drum and 0.8 and 2 m downwind, 1.00 every one; at 1.9 m 0.94 over the drum, 1.00 downwind; ALONG the wind (2 m upwind to 6 m down) 0.98 at 1.3 m, 1.00 at
  1.6 m, 0.92 at 1.9 m; overhead 0.55 at 2.6 m and 0.23 at 3.4 m (the smoke is there); with `?fire=0` every one of them 1.00. ONE wind, one level, open sky: a fire
  under a low roof or in still air may pool lower, and nobody measured that. `?firesmoke=0` (`FIRE.smoke.on`) is the fire with no smoke.
  THE SOUND: `fireBed` (a 7 s loop held as a follow voice, handed on every 12 s, asked again when a fire is lit again) and `fireCrack` with each pop — the mixer's
  alone, no event: nobody in the game hears a fire.
  WHAT IT COSTS, by the model and timed on no GPU: no light is added. The flame, coals and embers run in the composite, which every preset draws as its compute twin
  at OUTPUT size (timer row `compS`; the ladder counts it fixed, so the render scale cannot pay for it, only a preset hop): against High's 1000 rows Ultra × 1.44,
  Medium × 0.81, Low × 0.52, Very low × 0.36. Only pixels inside a fire's bound pay (a cylinder 1.3 m round it: with the game's 28° camera at 55° of pitch 5.5 % of a
  16:9 screen at the 21 m the game opens at, 14 % at 13 m, 68 % at the closest zoom, 6 m): about 2,300 operations a pixel there (ten ember tests, up to 24 more for
  1.5 s after a crack), and about 15,500 where the ray crosses the flame's marched cylinder (18 samples of six noise reads; 1.3 %, 3.3 % and 15.5 % of the screen —
  the cylinder is 1.9 mouth radii wide, the flame itself lives inside 1.1). (THE SECOND CUT MARCHES 24 SAMPLES, not 18: a third more on the flame's own pixels, none on the embers'.) Set against the resolve's row (0.25 ms at High for work of that order: a count, good to about
  three times either way) that was 0.20 ms at High at 21 m, 0.53 at 13 m and 2.5 at 6 m; since `fireFlame` returns before any read for a point the wobble cannot bring
  inside the rim, and right behind its two wobble reads for one that ends outside it (exact: the flame came out 0 there anyway, and `fire-lab.cjs`'s 24 frames are
  byte for byte the same, in still air and in wind), about 0.13, 0.35 and 1.6. The ember tests are most of the
  closest zoom's price and are as they were. THE SMOKE IS THE REAL COST and the same at every preset: the solver stays awake while a
  fire is within 18 m of the view — the plume alone holds about 1,100 bricks after twenty seconds when the solver is only
  stepped (497, 942, 1,119, 1,216 at 5, 10, 15 and 20 s, against 110 to 140 with the fire off) and the DRAWN page's pool read 2,242 fifteen seconds in against 901 with
  the fire off (the pass's own cold-weather smoke), so about 1,300 bricks: by the solver's own figures on the maintainer's Mac (0.39 µs a stepping brick, and 0.43
  ms for being awake at all on a level where nothing else smokes) 0.5 ms on the pass and about 0.95 ms where the fire is the only smoke. The plume was still
  growing slowly at twenty seconds. `?firesmoke=0` is the same fire without it, to weigh that on a GPU. BY PRESET, and the
  one rung that draws the fire without its smoke: FIRE SMOKE SHED, the next bullet.
  THE THIRD LOOK ON A GPU (2026-10-23, the maintainer playing the pass with the third cut: "this is looking better but still seems way too dark, especially
  relative to the other lights in the scene"; "i'd also expect the color from the fire to be more warm"; "would also expect the fire to be affected by the wind,
  looks like only the smoke is affected? fire sound can also be more prominent and crackly"; "shadows cast by the fire should be more dynamic i think. the fire as
  an emitter should be shifting continuously over time"; "fire getting put out by a grenade is weird"). WHAT WAS FOUND, and it explains every GPU look of the
  flame so far (pale blob, static, dim and see-through): THE TEMPORAL RESOLVE AVERAGED IT. `taau.wgsl` blends this frame in at a tenth, and its anti-flicker
  term quarters that where a neighbourhood is all contrast, which a flame on dark ground is: some forty frames of forty different flames. Particles, rain and
  smoke had reactive inputs; the composite's flame had none. Now the composite writes `1 − fireReact` into the HDR target's alpha (it was a constant 1 nobody
  read; `fireReact` = the opacity of the flame and its drawn smoke, `fire.wgsl fireVeil`, not its bed of coals, × `FIRE.look.react`), `gbaa.wgsl` carries that alpha through its rewrite, the fog of war, the outlines and the
  particle splat already kept it, and the resolve takes `react` from it like any other reactive pixel. The software adapter's stills were one frame at a time
  and never showed any of this. `?firereact=0` = averaged, as it was. THE LAMP (`FIRE.lift` 0.5, `.reach` 1.4, `.warm` [1, 0.72, 0.51], `.bright` 1.25;
  `?firebright=0` = 0.25, 1, no tint, 1): the level's lamp is 9 where a room's bulb is 26 and the gate's flood 70, and it hung a hand over the lid, where the
  drum's rim shadowed the ground a metre and a half round it (the dark ring in his shot, which ate most of the fire's pool). MORE STRENGTH IS NOT THE ANSWER:
  the tone curve pales a bright orange on snow to cream (lit snow a metre off is 0.95, 0.88, 0.77 at strength 9), so strength reads as whiter, not warmer, and
  a flame cannot look bright over ground brighter than itself. Tried at × 3 in the real page (software adapter): the yard washed out and the flame went pale
  against it. So the lamp is lifted into the flame, tinted deeper, carries 1.4 times as far (6.5 m to 9.1 m on the pass) and is only a quarter stronger, and
  the brightness is the FLAME's: `look.gain` 2 (was 1), `look.core` 1.4 (was 1), chosen on `fire-lab.cjs`'s stage from the play camera on snow (`LAMPK`,
  `LAMPC`, `LAMP` are that tool's words for the lamp). THE GAME READS THE LAMP: the check's `lamp` line reads the light meter three metres off at 0.544 by
  the level's lamp and 0.884 by a fire's at × 2 (the line's own number, not the page's), and the steady readers are told the lamp as it is; the fog of war's
  remembered picture packs a burning fire's lamp at that same steady strength (`fogofwar.ts`, one expression: its colour and reach were the live lamp's already).
  THE LAMP SHIFTS (`FIRE.wander` 0.14, `.wanderUp` 0.10,
  were 0.06 and 0.04; `?firesway=0`): how far a shadow's edge moves; whether the shadow history averages that motion away is the direct light's question,
  not looked at. THE WIND LEANS THE FLAME (`FIRE.look.lean` 0.2, was a constant 0.07 in the shader; `?firelean=0` = 0.07): `fireBend` = lean · y^1.5
  through the flame's body (y in flame heights, to 1.5) and on at two fifths of that slope above it, for the flame, its smoke off the tips and the shimmer, so
  the flame lies over some 45° in the pass's storm (the wind handed on is capped at `windMax` 3 m/s) and the marched bound grows to about 2.1 m round the
  drum from 1.6 (a straight y^1.5 at this lean made it 3 m and more). With `?firelean=0` the smoke over y 1.5 leans a little less than it did (the same
  curve at the old number): the picture only. `FIRE_STEPS` 40, was 32. SOUND: `bed` 0.85
  (was 0.5), `crack` 0.9 (was 0.55), `popRate` 1.1 a second (was 0.55): the fire's own levels, no change to the sound table or the mixer; more cracks is also
  more flashes of the lamp and more throws of embers. A FIRE IS NOT PUT OUT BY A ROUND OR A BLAST (`FIRE.hardy`, `?firehardy=0`): `combat.ts`'s fixture rule
  and `destruction.ts`'s (`fixtureLive`, the blast's fixture loop, `fixtureRound`) take a fire that `fireHolds` for no fixture at all, so a lamp behind one can
  still be shot, and call `fireStir` where the hit lands (a crack at rate 0.7 and a throw of embers on the fire's next frame from the host's book, one in
  `stirGap` 0.3 s however long the burst); nothing is counted against the encounter's fixtures or `AIMCOST_STATS.lampHits`, no light event goes to the
  guards. Its own box blown away (`breakFixtureBox`) still takes it, and so does a level's own switch or script. Driven through the real `bang` beside the
  pass's brazier on the shipped stand: out with the rule off, burning and stirred once with it on.
  THIS REMOVES A WAY TO MAKE DARK: a brazier cannot be shot out any more, which is the maintainer's to weigh for the quiet missions. A recording from before any
  of these keys replays with the level's lamp, no reactive flame, the 0.07 lean and a fire a round puts out (`journal.ts`). The lab (`/firelab`) has a slider for
  each: how fresh each frame of the flame is, how far the wind leans it, how orange / strong / far-carrying / high the light is, how far it shifts, and a
  section for the sound. NOT MEASURED: tallies on the shipped stand with the brighter lamp (guards by a fire are better lit and see further into its pool);
  no soak or tour run. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU: the reactive flame (the whole point of it), the lamp's colour, the lean, the shifting shadows.
  THE MAINTAINER'S OWN NUMBERS (2026-10-24, from the fire lab's "copy them" line on his GPU, taken as sent and made the table's defaults): `look` gain 3, core 4
  (both the top of their sliders, which now go to 8 and 10), sigma 2.5 (a thin veil where it was 12), speed 0.7, tall 0.95, torn 1.1, shimmer 0.019, soot 0.5;
  `height` 1.15 (was 0.75: the smoke's foot, the gas's and the embers' heights go up with it), `coals` 0.26 (the lid's glow, which the GPU meter reads through
  the bounce), `depth` 0.4 and `kick` 0.6, 60 embers of 1.7 s and 4 mm, and the drifting smoke at density 1, heat 21, speed 0.9 (thinner and slower than the
  2.2, 30, 1.5 whose sight lines are measured above: less of it, nothing measured again). THE GAME READS depth and kick: with the level's lamp (the check's
  `meter` line, frozen stand, one seed, twenty seconds) the light estimate 1.25 m off swings 1.785 to 4.701 about a steady 3.350 (mean 7.1 % under) and 3 m
  off 0.338 to 0.806 about 0.533 (0.6 % under), where the figures quoted further up were for depth 0.3 and kick 0.25; the lamp's own long-run mean is about a
  twentieth over the authored (the kick's share at 1.1 cracks a second), so the check's two mean bars are a tenth now, were a twentieth. HE SET THESE ON THE
  BUILD BEFORE the rules of the paragraph above, so the picture with them is not the one he tuned: the nearest to that is
  `?firereact=0&firelean=0&firebright=0&firesway=0` (twice the cracks and `FIRE_STEPS` 40 have no word). TWO MENDS FOR HIS NUMBERS: the reactive mark is
  `min(1, 4 × fireVeil)`, since at sigma 2.5 ten centimetres of flame is only a fifth opaque and its tongues would have gone back to the history; and the
  lamp's shift up and down is held to `wanderUp` (the kick is past the swing, and at 0.6 over 0.4 it snapped the lamp 15 cm in a frame with each crack).
  NOT his: `wander` (he sent 0.07; his note asking for shadows that move came with it, so it stays 0.14). COST, not timed: at sigma 2.5 next to no ray goes
  opaque, so nearly every flame pixel runs all 40 samples, over a bound a sixth taller. `fire-lab.cjs`'s look, height, kick, swing and lid glow follow.
  NOT SEEN by anyone with `react`, the lifted lamp and the lean together.
  FOUR MENDS FROM A REVIEWER'S READ OF THE CODE (2026-10-24; a fifth read, that the lamp's newer rows ride `FIRE.on` on the frozen stand with no row of their
  own, is true and as meant: no frozen digest or fixture is recorded with `TPS_FIRE=1`, and the check pins them itself). (1) A FIRE PUT OUT WHERE NOBODY SEES is
  remembered in the fog as a fire's light: `fire.ts held` keeps its tint and reach and its steady strength while the fog holds its ghost, and `fogofwar.ts`
  takes the ghost's strength from that steady record (it was the level's, a fifth dimmer, paler and shorter, at the lid). It is held from the very frame it
  goes out, one frame ahead of the fog's say. ONLY under the fog's full picture with `FIRE.fog` on: with `?fogfull=0` or `?firefog=0` the fog remembers the
  level's lamp, as before. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU. (2) `fireStir`'s gap is each fire's own: a grenade between two braziers stirs both. (3) The player's round stirs a fire on the older lamp
  search too (`AIMCOST.lamp` off, or a show on the stage), and that search goes on past the fire to a lamp behind it. (4) A floor with no fire tells the solver
  to let hot gas go (`keepHot(0)`); the page stands one game on a fresh solver a level, so nothing reaches this today. The check's fog, hardy and gas
  lines hold each; (3) stirs on a round that STOPPED in the drum, the newer search's own rule. RUN SINCE, and it found the rule itself short: a fire's own box is its glowing lid, a finger thick, and the drum is four boxes of the level's that name no fire, so a round into the drum stirred nothing on any path (the line of October 23 called `fireStir` itself and never fired a round). `fire.ts fireStruck` now says a round stopped in a fire when it stopped in the fire's box OR in a box that stands on the fire's axis under its mouth, within the drum's wall (1.7 lids, 0.3 m at least; a wall behind the drum or the ground beside it is no drum); the player's two lamp searches and `destruction.ts fixtureRound` (everyone else's rounds) ask it. `fire-check`'s hardy line fires a real round into the drum from three metres by each search: one stir each, still burning.
  CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts fire` (`tools/qa/fire-check.ts`, families `render`, `all`; twenty-three lines, both stands; `FIRE_BREAK=1` fails twenty-one): the lamp's swing
  and place, a second game the same frame for frame, the bed and the cracks, out and lit again, a checkpoint load (and the bed asked for again behind it; kept through frames that move no clock; asked for again behind a restart), the smoke's sources (look-only, coarse, foot over
  heads; none without a solver, on a preset that sheds it, or with the smoke put off; the game that smoked for twelve seconds and the one nothing drew differ in
  nothing of the fire's state), the steady readers, the lamp's size (0.24 m burning, the steady readers told the level's 0.06 and reading the same to the bit a hand from the lamp; the level's
  size with `size` 0, with the switch off and in a recording without the key), the CPU estimate (1.25 m off: steady 3.350, burning 2.02 to 4.24, mean −9.3 %; 3 m: 0.533 against 0.35 to 0.71,
  mean −3.1 %; with `lift` 0.3 the near one read −11.9 % and the line was red, which is why the lamp stands at 0.25), off = the build as it was, an old recording. THE SHADER ALONE: `node tools/qa/fire-lab.cjs` (seconds; where the look was set). THE REAL PAGE:
  `node tools/qa/fire-page.cjs` (software adapter, minutes; EVERY FIGURE AND STILL FROM HERE TO "NOT DONE" IS THE FIRST CUT'S, lamp 6 cm and `lift` 0.2: of the
  second cut the page was drawn at High from the still's own view, `QUALITY=high VIEWS=shot W=640 H=350`, 119 of 119 pipelines, two stills: a red and orange flame
  with a yellow root standing clear of the snow, the drum's shadow a soft dark foot round it — on the octagon drum, before ROUND joined): it boots with the switch either way (119 of 119 pipelines, no page error) and
  the stills are on the fire's page (rebuild/fire/): a flame on a bed of coals with the man beside it, the wall and the snow lit warm, a pale plume leaning downwind — against
  a white lid. THE GPU METER there, the same sixteen frames of the same game with the fire and without (the player's `visibility`): at 1.25 m 0.941 to 0.949
  burning against 0.952 to 0.955 steady; 3 m 0.635 to 0.717 against 0.605 to 0.631; 5 m 0.375 to 0.674 against 0.398 to 0.608 (the storm's lightning is in both). Half
  a second a stand: enough to say the flicker moves the meter by hundredths, not to give its swing.
  SEEN ON A GPU, ONCE (2026-10-23, the maintainer's Mac at High on the pass, one still; his words: "fire looks a bit jank tbh"). What the still showed, none of
  which the software adapter at Low had: (1) THE FLAME WAS A PALE SOFT BLOB with no tongues and no red. It was thin (`FIRE_SIGMA` 8) and ADDED to snow its own lamp
  lights as bright as it is, and its heart was radiance 5: the tone curve (AgX at exposure 2) turns a red above about 1 and a yellow above about 2.5 to cream, so
  brighter only read as paler. (2) A HARD BLACK DISC A METRE ROUND THE DRUM: the drum's own shadow from a lamp 6 cm in radius 36 cm over its rim. (3) THE COALS
  READ GREY: their gaps were radiance 3 and up, cream by the same curve. THE SECOND CUT (the same day) is the numbers above: the flame hides what is behind it and its
  colours stay under the curve's shoulder, the lamp is the flame's size and a little higher, the coals' gaps are 1.15 × a deep orange. It was set in `fire-lab.cjs`
  from his camera (`DIST=7 PITCH=50 ALB=0.85`: snow; the stage's lamp now casts the soft shadow, `LAMP` and `SIZE`) and
  `fire-page.cjs` has his view (`VIEWS=shot`, `DPR=2`). THE SECOND CUT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN ON A GPU.
  NOT DONE, KNOWN: the flame's clock wraps
  every 68 minutes (one frame's jump in its shape); `brazier*` is a name rule, not a level key; a brazier can still be shot out or jammed and the flame dies with
  its lamp. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU OR HEARD: the flame in motion through the temporal resolve (its 18-step dither, one-pixel embers under the clip), the flicker's
  feel on the yard, the plume, the sound, and every cost above.
- **The floor rung draws an open fire without its smoke (FIRE SMOKE SHED: `settings.fireSmokeShed`, `ui/quality.ts fireSmokeOf`; 2026-10-23).** Asked when the fire
  was merged: price it by preset, and say whether a preset should drop its smoke. The maintainer's rule stands (the smoke stays near High and other things pay the frame
  budget first), so this is the one rung with nothing left to pay. THE PRICE, by the cost model and timed on no GPU: the fire's smoke is the solver's fixed 0.5 ms (other
  smoke already keeps the solver awake, as the men's breath does on the pass) to 0.95 ms (the fire is the only smoke) at EVERY preset — 1,300 bricks at 0.39 µs a
  stepping brick, + 0.43 ms awake; every preset solves with high's four pairs since ONE SMOKE SOLVE, which is what that figure was measured at. Against each rung's
  modelled compute at its own scale on the maintainer's Mac, and what the ladder's render scale gives up on a machine that only just holds the rung at its 15 ms:
  ultra 31.3 ms, 2 to 3 %, 1 to 2 % of its rows; high 14.5, 3.5 to 6.5 %, 3 to 5 %; medium 8.7, 6 to 11 %, 5 to 10 %; low 4.6, 11 to 20 %, 12 to 24 % (past the
  0.5 scale floor where the fire is the only smoke: that machine hops to verylow beside a fire); verylow 2.9, 17 to 32 %, and it cannot be paid — its whole per-pixel
  part is 1.0 model-ms on the scale floor, 15 ms becomes 17.6 to 19.8. The flame's own price is the bullet above. THE RULE: a preset with `smokeOwn` (verylow: the rung that
  already keeps its own cheap smoke under SMOKE KEEP, for the same reason) draws the fire with its flame, embers, light and sound and files no smoke source; every
  rung above keeps the smoke and the scale pays. UP FROM THE FLOOR THE SHED STANDS ONE RUNG (`fireSmokeFor`): auto prices the hop verylow → low off a frame measured
  with no fire smoke, so a low that put the smoke back would be 0.5 to 0.95 ms short beside a fire, fall to the floor, find room and hop again, the plume coming and
  going each time. While AUTO moves the preset, low reached from verylow keeps the shed; the smoke is back at medium (where the scale has the room: the hop low →
  medium is priced without it too, and medium's scale has 6 to 11 % to give) or when a preset is put on by hand; a machine that came DOWN to low keeps its smoke. HOW: `Quality.apply` writes `settings.fireSmoke` (render-side, never `FIRE.smoke.on`: that table rides the journal
  and a graphics preset must not write it), `game/fire.ts updateFire` reads it beside the solver's `drawing`; a fire that gets its smoke back (a hop up the ladder)
  smokes the same frame, and one that loses it just stops filing: the plume there thins out by itself and the solver sleeps when its bricks are let go. SWITCH:
  `settings.fireSmokeShed`, default on, `?fireshed=0` = every preset keeps the fire's smoke, as it was (render-side like ONE SMOKE SOLVE: no `FROZEN_HOLDS` row, no
  journal line; `?firesmoke=0` still puts the smoke off at every preset). WHAT IT IS NOT: a game rule on any stand (the source is look-only, and no headless stand
  has a solver that draws) — but in the PAGE a sight line reads the solver, so beside a fire a line over a standing man's head (the fire's notes: 0.92 to 0.94 kept
  at 1.9 m, 0.55 at 2.6 m, all of it at 1.7 m and under) reads the plume on low and up and none on verylow. Nobody in the game looks along such a line today.
  ALSO RENDER-SIDE BY WAIVER, to be confirmed: the key is read inside the game's update (beside `drawing`, itself a render setting). What it
  decides is kept out of the game's state: the fire's book of which smoke it filed and which bed voices it asked for is on the HOST, beside the list the
  renderer is handed (`engine.hostBooks.fire`, `fire.ts FireShown`; `host/api.ts HostBooks` is the one bag for such books, dropped whole by the put-back's one line, so a book kept there cannot be forgotten; `Game.engine` is in no snapshot), and `fire.states` holds only what the clock alone decides — so a
  preset or a solver moves no state hash through the fire (the fire check's line 'the host's, not the game's': the game that smoked for twelve seconds and the
  one nothing drew differ in no row of the fire's, and the lamp and the coals are the same to the bit). WHO ABANDONS THE MOMENT DROPS THE BOOK: a restart, and
  with it a file's or a checkpoint's load (`game.ts restartEncounter`, beside the line that empties the solver), and a save in memory put back
  (`host/putback.ts`); a fresh one is begun on the next frame that moves the clock, the smoke is filed and the bed asked for on that frame, and the abandoned
  moment's voice lets go — where before a load into an earlier twelve seconds left a burning fire silent until the next mark (the check's second load line,
  which runs the host's own `hostAfterPutBack`, `FIREBOOK_BREAK=1` undoes the put-back's line and fails it; and its 'restart' line: the clock does not move
  with a restart, a source and a bed on the next frame, once). A FRAME THAT MOVES NO CLOCK IS NOT A LOAD: the page updates the game with `dt` 0 for the kit
  page's still and a card's frozen still (a pause skips the update), and the first cut of this rule took every such frame for a load — the bed's voice was let
  go and asked for again and a source filed on the next frame (found by a review; the check's 'still' line and the preset line's last count were red on it).
  A second cut read the clock instead (a book is another moment's when the clock is not where it left it) and lost the restart, which does not move the
  clock: found by the next review before it left the branch. The book is kept by a fire's place among the level's, a frame stamp each, with no limit on how
  many. NOT KNOWN TO IT: whether the mixer still holds the bed (a page frozen past the mixer's own hold, `audio.ts FOLLOW_SECS`, resumes with no bed until
  the next twelve-second mark). A page replay under another preset
  still files other look sources (the men's breath kept its own word for the solver in the game's state until the step after: its book is the host's too now, `engine.hostBooks.breath`, `weather.md`). NOT DONE: the
  other look sources (the men's breath, the cigarette) still wake the solver on verylow, so on a level with them the shed saves the plume's bricks (0.5 ms) and not
  the 0.43 ms of being awake; `settings.fireSmoke` is written when a preset is put on, so the switch moved by hand on a running page waits for the next preset.
  CHECK: `bun run tools/qa/probes.ts ladder` (four lines: by hand, under auto up from the floor, the switch off, a bare mock; `FIRESHED_BREAK=1` fails two) and
  `probes.ts fire`'s line 'on the graphics preset that sheds it', the real `Quality` over the game's own settings (verylow put on: no source in four seconds; low put
  on: a source that frame; both stands; `FIRESHED_BREAK=1` fails it). THE REAL PAGE (the software adapter, the pass, 640 × 360, the player beside the brazier, the camera at 13 m; a
  frame is twenty seconds and more there, so this is half a second of the game): verylow pinned, on this text, boots 119 of 119 pipelines with no page error, `fireSmoke`
  false, the flame drawn over the drum (the shader's two early returns compiled into the composite), and in sixteen frames no source filed and no brick in the solver's
  pool; low put on in that page: a source that same frame, 64 bricks, then 151 fifteen frames on. With `?fireshed=0` (a page from before the auto rule and the
  shader's first bound were written; stopped early, so its error list was never read): verylow boots 119 of 119, `fireSmoke` true, a source filed within the first
  eight frames, 125 bricks. NEVER SEEN ON A GPU, and nobody has watched the ladder move beside a fire: the auto rule is the self-test's alone. A take that would settle the prices: the pass and mission 1's level by the fire, F8 at high and low, the page / `?firesmoke=0` / `?fire=0`, at the zoom the
  game opens at and at the closest; and a fire under a roof, where the plume pools (never measured).
